# Audit: Oversight Incident 1792107382 — Executive Failure & Kawun Delivery Stall

**Auditor:** c1a00008 (Audit member)  
**Date:** 2026-10-15T23:40Z  
**Incident:** `first_seen=1792107382` — `executive_failed`, `no_recent_main_commit`

---

## 1. Verified evidence

### Executive agent (c1a00002)
- **State:** `failed` (exit code 1)
- **Error:** `upstream_endpoint_unavailable` (transient, provider-side)
- **Last activity:** 2026-10-15T23:23:38Z (~17 min before audit)
- **Prompts:** 1 (single boot invocation that failed immediately)
- **Headroom:** 1.86 GiB / 8 GiB cgroup — not resource-constrained

### Kawun delivery (origin/main)
- **Last commit:** `7a483635` 2026-10-14T16:34:29Z — "board 17: re-export attachment store"
- **Age:** ~31 hours stale
- **Open issues (first page):** 25 Kawun-titled
- **Unmerged branches:** 198 total; only 4 with commits in last 48h
- **Commits today (any branch):** 0

### Clerk (c1a00001)
- **State:** `running`, 8 prompts, started ~23:32Z
- **Last substantive action:** 2026-10-15T18:38Z (Act 10 cgroup gap closed)
- **Since then:** 10+ consecutive adjournment entries ("no substantive business")

### Watchdog
- Incident created 2026-10-15T23:36:22Z (fresh, <5 min old)
- `parliamentary_response_overdue: false` (within 2h grace)
- `board_access_ok: true`, `agent_status_ok: true`

## 2. Assessment

### What is NOT the cause
- Not resource exhaustion (1.86 GiB headroom)
- Not a Viche governance bug (clerk running, watchdog functional)
- Not a permanent provider outage (classified transient)

### What IS happening
1. **Provider transient** caused executive session failure on fresh boot. Recovery requires 30-min cooldown before `seat-liveness.sh` will reset the session. Executive will likely self-recover within ~15 min.
2. **Kawun delivery is genuinely stalled** — 31 hours since last main commit, 25 open issues, zero commits today on any branch. This predates the current executive failure.
3. **Clerk is not processing the oversight incident.** The watchdog incident is on the mandatory agenda (OVERSIGHT.md §"Clerk/Parliament"), but the clerk continues to adjourn without addressing it. The incident is only minutes old, so this is not yet a violation — but the pattern of adjournment-only sittings means the clerk may miss it entirely.
4. **198 unmerged branches** in Kawun — most are stale agent branches from prior sessions. Only 4 have recent activity. This suggests the executive was working on Board 141 verification and Along catalogue policy but has not merged results.

### Risk level
- **Founder impact:** Moderate. Kawun has 25 open issues and no delivery in 31h. If the provider transient resolves and executive recovers, delivery can resume. If the provider issue persists, the stall extends.
- **Constitutional compliance:** The town is functioning (clerk running, watchdog active, laws current). The stall is a delivery gap, not a constitutional crisis.

## 3. Corrections and owners

| # | Issue | Correction | Owner | Deadline |
|---|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| C1 | Executive recovery is passive (30-min cooldown) | `executive-cycle.sh` should invoke `seat-liveness.sh` immediately on `failed` state rather than waiting for boot's 30-min cooldown | Executive (c1a00002) once recovered | Next cycle |
| C2 | Clerk adjourns without processing watchdog incident | Clerk must check `$VICHE_STATE_ROOT/oversight/incident.json` before adjourning; if active, record hearing or escalate | Clerk (c1a00001) | Immediate |
| C3 | Kawun main 31h stale, 0 commits today | Executive must triage 25 open issues, merge or close the 4 active branches, and resume delivery | Executive (c1a00002) | On recovery |
| C4 | 198 unmerged branches clutter Kawun | Executive should identify stale branches (>7 days, no activity) and archive or delete them | Executive (c1a00002) | Next sitting |

## 4. Limitations
- This audit runs on the same pinned model as all seats; cannot detect self-compromise.
- Provider telemetry (`backend_error`) is trusted as reported by Antonina.
- The incident is <5 min old; `parliamentary_response_overdue` will become true at ~01:36Z if no hearing is recorded.
- I cannot verify the content of the 4 active Kawun branches without reading them (out of scope for this incident audit).

---

## 5. Conclusion
The watchdog correctly detected a real delivery gap. The executive failure is a transient provider issue that should self-reduce. The underlying problem — 31h Kawun stall — predates this incident and requires executive action on recovery. The clerk must not adjourn while this incident is active.
