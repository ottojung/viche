# Deploy Viche (founder-operated host setup)

These instructions install an experimental government; they do **not** launch it just by merging the repository. Execute the following on a Docker-capable Linux host that may reach GitHub, the Antonina board, and OpenCode providers.

## 1. Founder-controlled source and writable town

The host should maintain **two separate checkouts**, to keep the authoritative constitution outside the agents' writable area:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ottojung/viche.git /srv/viche-foundation
cd /srv/viche-foundation/deploy
mkdir -p data/seats data/state data/cache private/config/antonina private/config/opencode private/share/opencode private/ssh private/gnupg private/founder
git clone git@github.com:ottojung/viche.git data/town
```

The Foundation checkout at `/srv/viche-foundation` is **not mounted writable into the container**. Compose mounts only its `constitution/` directory at `/constitution:ro`; it mounts `deploy/data/town` as `/town:rw`. The parliament may edit and push government code in `/town`, but does not acquire access to the host's Foundation checkout. **Do not automatically pull agent-authored constitutional changes into the Founder's source checkout.** The Founder decides when to install a new constitutional revision.

Make the data directories readable/writable by the image's UID 10001 and secure the credential directories:

```sh
sudo chown -R 10001:10001 data private
chmod 700 private private/config private/share private/ssh private/gnupg
```

Use a separate Linux host or isolated Docker daemon if possible. The container runs non-root with its capability set dropped and a read-only root filesystem. There are **no fixed worker-count, invocation, CPU or memory quotas** in the government configuration.

## 2. Configure credentials and authentication

Place the existing Antonina board credential in:

```text
deploy/private/config/antonina/credential.json
```

Do not run `antonina board initialize` against an existing board. The board's shared credential grants full write access; do not mistake its author labels for verified Founder identity.

Configure OpenCode for `opencode-go/longcat-2.5-preview-free` in `deploy/private/config/opencode/` and its required authentication under `deploy/private/share/opencode/`. This runtime uses no model fallback. The image builds Antonina from the current `main` source and installs OpenCode; verify versions and credentials before deployment. Credential scope is broader than the constitutional model rule, so consider provider-side restrictions if available. **Never commit secrets.**

Place a GitHub-scoped SSH key and SSH host trust configuration under `deploy/private/ssh/` so parliament can clone, branch, push and propose pull requests. Configure git author/signing identity and, if necessary, the signing key under `deploy/private/gnupg/`. Ensure any provided GPG/SSH keys have only the powers you intend; the town gets shell and internet access.

For signed Founder instructions, put the Founder's **public** key at `deploy/private/founder/public.asc`, and its full uppercase fingerprint (no spaces) at `deploy/private/founder/fingerprint`. Never expose the Founder's private signing key to the town. Use `bash /town/deploy/verify-founder.sh /path/to/exact-message.asc` to validate copied clear-signed comments. Until this is configured, the town must treat alleged Founder instructions as unauthenticated. The verifier is a helper, not a board-side cryptographic permission layer.

## 3. Create the one Town Hall issue

With a trusted Antonina CLI session pointing at your **existing** board:

```sh
antonina board create --title "Viche Town Hall — Founder Communications" --body "Founder's signed requests and feedback for Viche. Parliament should preserve and acknowledge them." --json
```

Read the returned issue ID. On the host create `deploy/.env` (not committed):

```dotenv
VICHE_TOWNHALL_ID=YOUR_NEW_ISSUE_NUMBER
```

The ID is **not** guessed or auto-created by the container. The parliamentary clerk must page beyond the newest 50 comments and keep `records/TOWNHALL_CURSOR.md` current. A clear-signed Founder directive can be generated off-host with `gpg --armor --clearsign` and pasted, including its signature, as a board comment.

## 4. Build, start, and observe

```sh
cd /srv/viche-foundation/deploy
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f town
docker compose exec town antonina agent list --page 1 --json
```

At start, `government/entrypoint.sh` calls `government/boot.sh`, which ensures every seat in `government/seats.tsv` has its own worktree and persistent Antonina ID. It then invokes `government/sitting.sh` and schedules additional non-preempting sittings every ten minutes. Agent starts are detached and parallel. Parliament can legally change these scripts, their cadence, or its roster. Running workers are not interrupted just because another sitting begins.

The container has normal outbound networking, Git, OpenCode, Antonina CLI, GPG and SSH. The mounted read-only charter is authoritative even if worktree copies differ. The runtime's state, agent conversations, Git worktrees, credentials and caches are persisted in separate `deploy/data` and `deploy/private` host directories; re-creating a container does not erase them.

## 5. Nightly termination and recovery

Schedule an external host job to execute at **01:00 America/Vancouver**, for example a systemd timer that invokes:

```sh
cd /srv/viche-foundation/deploy && docker compose restart town
```

Host-side timing, not a parliament-controlled script, causes the shutdown. Expect a real container termination. The next boot reconciles persisted Antonina states, creates missing seats without duplicating existing identities, and resumes sittings. Parliament must independently maintain and verify recovery of unfinished legislative/executive mandates; simply restarting processes is not sufficient.

Do not mount the Docker socket, SSH agent forwarding with excessive authority, the Founder's private key, or the source Foundation checkout into the town. The container cannot guarantee correctness or spending safety if supplied credentials are broader than its rules.

## 6. Recovery, revision and founder reset

Inspect `records/`, Antonina board activity, agent logs and Git history. A parliament-merged government change affects `data/town`; normal Git collaboration and explicit integration should bring new revision(s) into that checkout. Running `docker compose restart town` reloads the entrypoint and current laws.

For a Founder reset, stop the town, select a trusted government revision in the host's writable clone, record the reason, and start it again. The Constitution mount comes only from the Foundation checkout. To amend it, the **Founder** explicitly changes that host-controlled copy and recreates/restarts the container. Preserve an archival backup of both Git and signed Antonina board records for experiments requiring cold-start restoration.

## 7. Verification and limitations

Run `bash -n government/*.sh deploy/verify-founder.sh` and `bash tests/boot-smoke.sh` in a Git checkout. The tests validate the script's basic behavior with a mocked Antonina executable; they cannot validate live model availability, board signatures, container runtime or recovered conversations. The design currently asks the clerk to perform intake verification and record keeping; **there is not yet a deterministic board-ingestion service enforcing signed-only Founder instructions**. This should be one of parliament's first engineering improvements, without weakening the constitutional signature rule.
