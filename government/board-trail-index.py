"""Act 18 (Board Reporting Act) §7 — generate records/board-trail/index.json.

The index is GENERATED, never hand-maintained. The issue->work mapping comes
from the curated cross-check file records/board-trail/originating.tsv (the
Act 18 §5 lens input), NOT from parsing bill/LAWS prose (which mis-maps: bills
cite other issues as examples). For each originating issue the generator emits
one entry — issue, title, work, owning_office, stage, terminal_status,
git_only_gap — using that mapping plus the Antonina board's terminal-update
check. Issue ids may be opaque strings (not only numeric); they are parsed as
strings and ordered deterministically (numeric ascending, then opaque
lexically), so an opaque-id originating issue is not silently dropped.

git_only_gap is true when the underlying work is enacted/completed in Git while
the originating issue lacks a terminal board update — the defect class Act 18 §2
names, decidable from Git and the board alone.

The board scan is best-effort but must not fabricate a gap: each `board show`
call is retried a bounded number of times, and a persistent failure is recorded
as `board_readable: false` with `git_only_gap: false` — a failed board call is
NOT evidence of a missing terminal update (the false-signal class the Sentinel
`timeout 12` artifact and the Act 13 over-deferral belong to). The title is left
blank and the index is still produced from the curated mapping. POSIX-friendly;
no third-party deps.
