"""Durable cross-branch corrective cases, with evidence-based operational closure.

A case is a monitored obligation, NOT a Judiciary verdict or an authorization
to enact law. Observation and routing remain deterministic even if every model
is down. Existing independent Judiciary/Parliament/Executive powers remain.

This collector never closes a case. Closure is a recorded manual decision by
the Clerk after independently inspecting a Judiciary disposition. The Clerk
writes a case-bound closure_evidence artifact; the mechanical check below only
verifies that the artifact is complete and attributed, never that it is true.
