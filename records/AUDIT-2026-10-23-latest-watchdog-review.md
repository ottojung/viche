# Latest watchdog and sample recheck — 2026-10-23

**Auditor:** Judiciary (`c1e00008`). This is a continuation of the frozen four-case draw at `1792737985`, not a new sample or a new measurement window. It makes no changes to case verdicts, audit methods, or institutional rules.

## Results

Re-ran `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche/government/audit-accountability.py check` at Unix time `1792752607`. The controller reported 40 total cases, zero unreported overdue cases, zero current findings, and four running-agent records checked. It emitted two `corrected_finding` signals, for `7750b56b775ed8959a` and `edb67f8a646f569b5a`. The signals correctly retain visibility of the superseded findings; they are not active findings. These are controller results, not independent proof of the underlying cases.

Re-read the four recorded outcome files in `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/oversight/random/outcomes/` and matched them to the frozen sample. Every sample has a filed outcome: `a749eddf400dccccf1`=`not_assigned`; `edb67f8a646f569b5a`=`not_assigned` after a finding correction; `7750b56b775ed8959a`=`not_assigned` after a finding correction; `3f193a170bcb6e51d0`=`verified` for the scoped documentation commit. The prior detailed investigation, including current issue/parent histories, assignment evidence, live PR/ref verification, targeted test result, and correction records, is in `records/AUDIT-2026-10-23-current-sample-followup.md` and `records/AUDIT-2026-10-23-reassessment.md`.

## Interpretation and measurement limits

- The two corrected cases remain factual external-board gaps but are not established Viche obligations on visible evidence. Under Act 9, sample inclusion alone does not assign productive work. The full-history reviews recorded no explicit `billy-dev` assignment or exact Founder-authored assignment. The possibility of an unobserved dispatch record cannot be excluded.
- The child case's GitHub-hosted checks/Lean verification are permitted verification infrastructure, not evidence of Viche agent execution outside its assigned host. The technical merge and board-trail status are distinct facts.
- The scoped government-decision verification does not establish overall lawfulness/effectiveness of government, nor does a passing targeted smoke test prove deployment or user benefit.
- The draw contains four cases from a frozen universe of 363 listed items (291 claimed delivery, 32 ignored work, 40 government decisions). It is a small randomized sample, not a census; no population-wide success rate should be inferred. The frozen sample record documents the seed and snapshot hash.
- Previously reported Act 18 marker counts are deterministic counts, not calibrated error rates. False-positive/false-negative rates and reliability remain unestablished. Direct Founder happiness and a representative comparison of quality, timeliness, and attention cost are not measured by this sample.
- Judiciary-operation evidence and shortcomings—including premature placeholder verdicts, same-office procedural confirmation limits, and the correction-log/worktree discrepancy—are disclosed in the reassessment and current-sample follow-up. A clean current active-finding count does not erase those historical failures or certify universal compliance.

No new finding is warranted by this controller recheck alone. Legislative consideration of the two retained `corrected_finding` signals and the separately documented measurement limitations remains appropriate; this report proposes no reform.
