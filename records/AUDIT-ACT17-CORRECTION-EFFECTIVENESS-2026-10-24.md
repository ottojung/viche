# Judiciary factual review — Act 17 correction-effectiveness signals

**Auditor:** Judiciary `c1e00008`. **Scope:** read-only reconstruction of the three persistent
`correction_not_effective` / `unresolved_inconclusive` case pairs in Controller snapshot
`1792872280`; no draw, correction, outcome, signal, log, code, or external issue was changed.
Current main inspected: `cddff6cf26edfeecb14989ca9ed9d007cc9a583c`.

## 1. Case-by-case record

The effective result below follows `government/audit-accountability.py` as committed: it reads
`HEAD:records/oversight/corrections/<case>.jsonl`; if no valid committed confirmed trail exists,
it restores the original verdict (or the first correction's `supersedes`) and emits
`correction_not_effective`. A confirmed state-cache correction alone is not legally effective
(Act 17 §2.2).

| Case | Frozen input / cache state | Retained correction JSONL | Cycle identity / HEAD status | Effective under current checker |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fae4b5c49a16cbcc3e` | Case draw `1792821154`; original cache verdict `inconclusive` at `1792821279`; cache now says `finding`, correction confirmed at `1792821382`, `correction_pending=false`. | 2 rows: `inconclusive`→`finding` filed `1792821379` (`confirmed:false`), procedural confirmation `1792821382` (`confirmed:true`). Both carry cycle token `bc0491f2d1b73344092c563a8a931c7f`. SHA-256 `64fec92dd25bc271b768c15edd3aac6ac37169236f717dca48e4c5a9e06c2cf4`. | Token is registered in state identity ledger at `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/oversight/audit-cycle-identities.tsv:2`, matching the case's draw. The correction file is untracked; `HEAD:<path>` is absent. | Original `inconclusive`; correction not effective until Git-anchored. Structurally, the existing pair has one filing and a matching same-office procedural confirmation for a registered token. |
| `7750b56b775ed8959a` | Frozen draw `1792737985`; cache now `not_assigned`, `correction_pending=false`; cached history includes first `inconclusive`→`finding` and later `finding`→`not_assigned`, with same-office confirmations. The exact original placeholder timestamp/evidence is not retained. | 3 rows: first filing `1792738483` (`confirmed:false`), same-office confirmation `1792738485` (`confirmed:true`), second filing `1792741896` (`confirmed:false`). No row has `cycle_id`; the cache's later confirmation at `1792741930` has no corresponding JSONL row. SHA-256 `a3d1236a98eb637afcd8d6822ff8e63c16dc4b4f70a407b83ef9ff76b9b29196`. | No identity-ledger entry exists for frozen draw `1792737985`; the current file is untracked and absent from `HEAD`. | Original `inconclusive`; neither cached correction is effective. Committing this file unchanged would fail the current committed-trail validator for missing cycle identity and unpaired second confirmation. |
| `edb67f8a646f569b5a` | Frozen draw `1792737985`; cache now `not_assigned`, `correction_pending=false`; cached history includes `inconclusive`→`finding` and later `finding`→`not_assigned`, both marked confirmed in cache. The exact original placeholder timestamp/evidence is not retained. | 3 rows: first filing `1792738435` (`confirmed:false`), same-office confirmation `1792738439` (`confirmed:true`), second filing `1792741902` (`confirmed:false`). No row has `cycle_id`; the cache's later confirmation at `1792741931` has no corresponding JSONL row. SHA-256 `bf7bf5fd3e7b04c6a0f8e12f82b189e7f67b519f38a324a5309cde8c0919ce20`. | No identity-ledger entry exists for frozen draw `1792737985`; the current file is untracked and absent from `HEAD`. | Original `inconclusive`; neither cached correction is effective. Committing this file unchanged would fail the current committed-trail validator for missing cycle identity and unpaired second confirmation. |

The three current files are present at canonical `records/oversight/corrections/` but none is tracked
or present at the matching `HEAD:` path. The Git-anchored archive
`records/oversight/source-evidence/2026-10-23/pr32-proposed/` is separately identified as
non-operative source evidence; it is not a substitute for the Act 17 authoritative correction path.

## 2. Timing and historical cycle facts

The two older cases share frozen sample timestamp `1792737985` = 2026-10-23T06:46:25Z.
Conversions from retained correction JSONL rows:

- #6 (`7750…`): correction filings at `1792738483` = 06:54:43Z and `1792741896` = 07:51:36Z;
  difference **3,413 seconds (56m53s)**. First procedural confirmation was `1792738485` =
  06:54:45Z; cache says the later confirmation was `1792741930` = 07:52:10Z, a
  **3,445-second (57m25s)** difference. That later confirmation is absent from the current JSONL.
- Journal child (`edb…`): correction filings at `1792738435` = 06:53:55Z and `1792741902` =
  07:51:42Z; difference **3,467 seconds (57m47s)**. First procedural confirmation was
  `1792738439` = 06:53:59Z; cache says the later confirmation was `1792741931` = 07:52:11Z,
  a **3,492-second (58m12s)** difference. That later confirmation is absent from the current
  JSONL.

These establish two correction filings per case associated with one frozen draw and intervals
under six hours. They do **not**, by themselves, settle the statutory meaning of “audit cycle”
for the historical period or establish a legal violation. The current prospective guard defines
cycle identity by frozen sample and explicitly disclaims retroactive adjudication
(`government/AUDIT-CYCLE-IDENTITY.md:43–49`). The state identity ledger has no token for the
1792737985 draw. The `bc0491f2…` token on `fae4…` belongs to its later, distinct draw
`1792821154` (2026-10-24T05:52:34Z), and cannot be transplanted to the older cases. Current
`current-audit-cycle` is `7842d14ae40d5574e278d0d5f53b2455` (draw registered at
`1792870236`); it is unrelated to all three correction chains.

## 3. What the current implementation does

- `committed_confirmed_correction()` (`government/audit-accountability.py:57–96`) queries Git
  `HEAD` only. Missing paths return no effective correction. A committed trail must have valid
  32-hex `cycle_id` values, at most one filing per case/token, and a paired confirmation with the
  same verdict. The three current files fail the first requirement in all cases except `fae4…`;
  the two old-case files additionally lack their second confirmation rows.
- `check()` (`:317–368`) does not accept the state cache's `correction_pending=false` or
  `confirmed:true` history as efficacy. With no valid committed trail, it falls back to
  `original_verdict` or the first correction's `supersedes` (`inconclusive`) and emits
  `correction_not_effective`; because those effective originals are overdue inconclusive cases,
  it also emits `unresolved_inconclusive`. This explains the supplied Controller snapshot's
  persistent signal pairs and zero effective findings versus the measurement cache's one
  `finding`.
- `used_cycle_tokens()` (`:112–124`) rejects any correction JSONL row lacking a valid cycle ID.
  A scratch-only reproduction with a copy of the #6 state/log and current token `7842…` returned
  exit 1: `authoritative correction trail has a correction without a valid cycle_id`; the copied
  log remained byte-unchanged. No production state or log was touched.

Thus acknowledgement, cached confirmation, or an untracked file cannot clear these signals. The
`fae4…` JSONL has a registered cycle identity and matching procedural confirmation, but is still
ineffective until its exact bytes are Git-anchored. The two older JSONLs cannot become effective
by simply committing them: their historical cycle identities and second confirmation rows are
missing, and the prospective guard rejects retroactive/invented identity.

## 4. Corrective path and separate legal owner

**Independently verifiable by this Judiciary:** the frozen case IDs/draws; cache histories and
correction-row contents/timestamps; each source file's tracked/untracked status; state identity
ledger contents; current implementation's HEAD-only efficacy check and identity validator; and
the supplied Controller/measurement discrepancy. Same-office procedural confirmations are
verifiable as recorded events, but are **not independent corroboration** (Act 17 §2.4).

**Reserved to c1a00005 and Legislature:** c1a00005 was assigned by the Clerk on the originating
issue at 2026-10-23T18:28:02Z to analyze the enacted Act 17 §2.6.1 limit, the historical
correction timestamps, the applicable historical cycle definition and counterarguments. In the
15-message current issue history inspected for this review, no c1a00005-authored legal analysis
or completed disposition was present; the latest relevant status still says the historical
question is unresolved. The factual second-office report records an *apparent* same-draw,
two-filing conflict but explicitly does not settle the legal interpretation. This Judiciary does
not decide whether the historical filings violated the six-hour statutory cap.

**No correction is made in this assignment.** The `fae4…` correction pair is structurally
compatible with the current validator if its existing JSONL is later Git-anchored unchanged;
this assignment forbids altering/anchoring logs. For `7750…` and `edb…`, there is no lawful
retroactive token in the retained evidence, and the present files fail current validation. The
exact blocker is the missing historical cycle identity plus missing paired confirmation rows;
the current 7842 token cannot repair either. The next evidence owner is c1a00005, for the
separate historical Act 17 cycle interpretation assigned by the Clerk. The Clerk/Legislature
then determines any legal disposition. Only after that, and only with an actually registered
future draw token and qualifying new durable evidence, can the Judiciary assess any prospective
correction path; a committed trail must then be checked against the exact Git HEAD. No
acknowledgement substitutes for that check.

No outcomes, correction logs, state, signals, code, or external issues were changed. No law or
procedural/measurement reform is proposed.
