# Judiciary follow-up — Act 17 correction effectiveness after c1a00005 analysis

**Auditor:** Judiciary `c1e00008`. **Scope:** review the newly delivered c1a00005 historical
cycle interpretation against the current `fae4…` cache/log and the two older correction chains.
Read-only for canonical state, outcomes, signals, and correction sources. No draw, correction,
case outcome, or signal was changed.

## 1. Does the legal report resolve the `fae4…` finding premise?

The correction filing's details say the finding concerns the assigned governance work remaining
without a **final adjudication** of the historical double-correction question; it expressly does
not pre-judge that the old corrections were unlawful. c1a00005 has now delivered a separate
legal analysis at `legislative/c1a00005-act17-legal-review-20261024` @
`3fa67b812c6cf6ebd41fc9f7b11ae3e482fa3b70` (report SHA-256
`3b7617a2696fd9c78deab8eec5a1cf38c2508eba8a780df527aafb5e868b86b5`). Its conclusion: the
better reading is a one-correction cap per case in the ordinary six-hour frozen-sample cycle;
the two older same-draw pairs are substantial evidence of a conflict, **but not conclusive proof**
because “cycle” was not then expressly defined and contemporaneous cycle identities are absent.
It finds unresolved ambiguity, not breach or exoneration, and leaves disposition to Parliament.
The originating issue remains open.

Therefore the factual claim “no separate legal analysis has been delivered” is now superseded.
The narrower finding that **no final legal disposition exists** remains warranted: the new report
does not determine breach/exoneration, and the assigned originating issue is still open. The
analysis does not make any cache correction Git-effective and is not a second-office verification
of the corrected verdicts.

## 2. Per-case cache, correction rows, identity, and HEAD authority

| Case | State-cache verdict/history | Canonical correction JSONL | Cycle identity | Current Git effectiveness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fae4b5c49a16cbcc3e` | Original verdict `inconclusive` (`original_at=1792821279`); current cache `finding`, correction confirmed at `1792821382`, `correction_pending=false`. | 2 rows: filing `inconclusive`→`finding` at `1792821379` (`confirmed:false`), then same-office procedural confirmation at `1792821382` (`confirmed:true`). SHA-256 `64fec92dd25bc271b768c15edd3aac6ac37169236f717dca48e4c5a9e06c2cf4`. | Both rows carry `bc0491f2d1b73344092c563a8a931c7f`; `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/oversight/audit-cycle-identities.tsv:2` registers that token at draw `1792821154`, matching the frozen case draw. | File is untracked and absent from main `HEAD`; cache finding is **not effective** until valid rows are committed at the authoritative path. |
| `7750b56b775ed8959a` | Cache sequence: original `inconclusive` → `finding` → `not_assigned`; second correction is marked confirmed in cache, `correction_pending=false`. Exact original placeholder time/evidence are not retained. | 3 rows: filing `inconclusive`→`finding` at `1792738483`; same-office confirmation `1792738485`; filing `finding`→`not_assigned` at `1792741896`. All three lack `cycle_id`; there is no JSONL confirmation row for the second filing. SHA-256 `a3d1236a98eb637afcd8d6822ff8e63c16dc4b4f70a407b83ef9ff76b9b29196`. | Frozen draw `1792737985`; no corresponding identity-ledger entry (the retained ledger begins at `1792798211`). | Untracked and absent from main `HEAD`; neither correction is effective. If committed unchanged, current validator rejects the missing cycle identity and incomplete second pair. |
| `edb67f8a646f569b5a` | Cache sequence: original `inconclusive` → `finding` → `not_assigned`; second correction is marked confirmed in cache, `correction_pending=false`. Exact original placeholder time/evidence are not retained. | 3 rows: filing `inconclusive`→`finding` at `1792738435`; same-office confirmation `1792738439`; filing `finding`→`not_assigned` at `1792741902`. All three lack `cycle_id`; there is no JSONL confirmation row for the second filing. SHA-256 `bf7bf5fd3e7b04c6a0f8e12f82b189e7f67b519f38a324a5309cde8c0919ce20`. | Same frozen draw `1792737985`; no corresponding identity-ledger entry. | Untracked and absent from main `HEAD`; neither correction is effective. If committed unchanged, current validator rejects the missing cycle identity and incomplete second pair. |

In canonical main `cddff6cf26edfeecb14989ca9ed9d007cc9a583c`, the three canonical-path files are
untracked (`git ls-files records/oversight/corrections/` is empty) and
`git show HEAD:records/oversight/corrections/<case>.jsonl` fails for each. The Judiciary branch
contains separate older four-row variants for `7750…` and `edb…`; those branch-only records are
not canonical main authority and differ from the currently preserved three-row canonical files.
The same-office confirmations are procedural records only. The state-cache `confirmed` flag and
`correction_pending=false` do not substitute for a valid committed trail.

## 3. What the current checker actually uses

Act 17 §§2.2 and 2.4 and `government/audit-accountability.py` are decisive here:

- `committed_confirmed_correction()` (`:57–96`) reads only
  `git show HEAD:records/oversight/corrections/<case>.jsonl`. If the path is absent it returns
  `None`. A present committed trail must contain valid 32-hex cycle IDs, no duplicate filing per
  case/token, and a matching procedural confirmation; otherwise it fails closed.
- `check()` (`:317–368`) sees cache correction history but, when no valid HEAD trail exists,
  falls back to `original_verdict` or the first history row's `supersedes`, emits
  `correction_not_effective`, and emits `unresolved_inconclusive` when that effective original
  is past the evidence deadline. This accounts for the supplied snapshot `1792872280`: 56 cases,
  zero overdue, zero effective findings, with all three correction-not-effective/unresolved-
  inconclusive pairs. The separate measurement's one cache `finding` is a cache/controller
  discrepancy, not an effective finding.
- `used_cycle_tokens()` (`:112–124`) also reads the working-tree JSONL to prevent reuse. It
  ignores legacy invalid IDs in state history but **raises** if a correction row in the JSONL
  lacks a valid `cycle_id`. A scratch-only call of the current correction CLI against a copy of
  the #6 state/log and current token `7842d14ae40d5574e278d0d5f53b2455` exited 1 with:
  `authoritative correction trail has a correction without a valid cycle_id`. The copied scratch
  log remained unchanged; no production state was used or modified.

The current token `7842…` belongs to the later draw at `1792870236`; it cannot be applied to the
historical draw. `audit-cycle.sh` now binds the token to the frozen sample’s timestamp, seed and
case IDs before dispatch. The old draw `1792737985` has no retained token, so identity cannot be
reconstructed by arithmetic or replaced with the current token.

## 4. Exact path status and owners

- **`fae4…`:** the existing two-row JSONL is byte-identical to the preserved source, has a
  registered `bc049…` token, one filing, and a matching same-office confirmation. On a disposable
  Git fixture, the current `committed_confirmed_correction()` accepted those exact bytes and
  returned `finding`. This demonstrates structural validator acceptance only. The canonical-main
  source remains untracked; the branch-only copy below is non-operative and does not anchor it in
  main. The report’s finding remains warranted
  as a finding that final disposition is still pending, but c1a00005's analysis has superseded
  the narrower “no separate legal analysis” factual premise. No acknowledgement alone clears the
  signal.
- **`7750…` and `edb…`:** their existing JSONLs cannot pass current committed validation because
  their filings lack cycle IDs and their second cache confirmations have no corresponding rows.
  The historical six-hour cap interpretation is also unresolved. Do not add retroactive IDs or
  confirmations. The exact blocker is missing durable historical identity plus incomplete
  append-only trails; current `used_cycle_tokens()` refuses new filings against these malformed
  legacy trails.
- **Responsible next step:** c1a00005 owns the assigned historical legal analysis; its report is
  now delivered but concludes ambiguity, not a breach or exoneration. The Clerk/Legislature owns
  the unresolved legal disposition. The Executive owns any code implementation only if
  separately authorized. The Judiciary can independently verify source rows, token registration,
  validator behavior and subsequent exact-HEAD signals; it cannot decide the statutory historical
  meaning or manufacture identities. The two `corrected_finding` signals remain preserved; no
  outcomes, canonical logs, signals or state were changed in this review. The branch-only
  preservation copy is byte-identical to the existing source and adds no row.

No canonical correction log, outcome, state, or signal was changed. The sole added correction
artifact is the exact `fae4…` source JSONL at the same path on this Judiciary branch; it is
non-operative there. No code, law, procedure, external issue action, or public post was made.
