## Reproduction and test results

From the scratch checkout, ran these exact commands; each exited 0:

|---|---|---|
| `sh tests/audit-cycle-identity-smoke.sh` | `Act17 frozen-sample identity and pre-launch durability passed` | `b4e53b55bb7bf4e75910641332b7eddd5d0f540e6f39710fdada23c6cd1a91ea` |

## Guard behavior verified in source and tests

1. **Stable token for a frozen sample:** `audit-cycle.sh` decides whether an incident dispatch reuses `random/latest.json` (while the sample is less than 21,600 seconds old) or draws a fresh sample. It hashes the frozen draw timestamp, seed and ordered case IDs into a 32-hex identity. The identity ledger and current-token file are populated before `antonina agent run`. The identity smoke test dispatches at `base` and `base+1801`, asserts the exact same token and one identity-ledger row, then checks a post-six-hour fresh sample has a different token.
2. **Before-dispatch persistence and ambiguous launch:** the mocked `agent run` checks that both current token and exactly one ledger entry already exist. A failed/ambiguous launch is recorded; another call before cadence does not dispatch a duplicate. This verifies ordering and retry suppression in the script/test harness, not that a real backend accepted or ran the agent.
3. **Concurrent report serialization:** `audit-accountability.py report` opens a per-case lock file and holds `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)` across read/check/append/cache. The correction smoke starts two concurrent correction processes for one case/cycle and asserts exactly one succeeds and one append exists.
4. **No ordinary-report bypass after correction:** report code rejects ordinary verdict updates whenever prior history contains a correction. The test asserts ordinary overwrite fails after confirmed finding correction, after a confirmed finding→non-finding correction, and after a confirmed non-finding correction; it also checks ordinary overwrite is blocked while a correction is pending. This is keyed off correction history in the state cache and does not itself make that cache legally authoritative.
5. **Git-anchored effectiveness:** `committed_confirmed_correction()` reads only `git show HEAD:<correction path>`, validates cycle IDs and paired filed/confirmation rows, and supplies effective state only from that committed trail. `check()` falls back to the recoverable original verdict and emits `correction_not_effective` if no valid committed confirmed correction exists; it does not accept untracked or modified correction-file bytes. Tests demonstrate pending correction remains ineffective, a confirmed but uncommitted retraction is rejected as effective, and a committed paired trail changes the effective verdict. The canonical checkout's untracked/working correction material is therefore not enough to enact these corrections in this checker.

## Scratch reproduction of the historical signals

Copied the current canonical `oversight/random` inputs into `/tmp/opencode/act17-canonical-repro/state/oversight/random`, cloned canonical repository HEAD into the isolated `townrepo` (which resolved to the exact verified SHA), and used a scratch mock Antonina returning an empty readable inventory. Ran the exact checked-in `government/audit-accountability.py check` with `VICHE_OVERSIGHT_NOW=1792797804`, scratch-only state and scratch clone as `VICHE_TOWN_ROOT`. The resulting JSON was:

```json
{
  "at": 1792797804,
  "cases_total": 40,
  "cases_unreported_overdue": 0,
  "finding_count": 0,
  "signals": [
    {"type":"correction_not_effective","case_id":"7750b56b775ed8959a","reason":"no valid confirmed correction committed in Git HEAD"},
    {"type":"unresolved_inconclusive","case_id":"7750b56b775ed8959a"},
    {"type":"correction_not_effective","case_id":"edb67f8a646f569b5a","reason":"no valid confirmed correction committed in Git HEAD"},
    {"type":"unresolved_inconclusive","case_id":"edb67f8a646f569b5a"}
  ],
  "assessment":"requires_investigation_not_a_guilt_verdict"
}
```

Interpretation: for both cases, state-cache correction history claims confirmed corrections, but HEAD has no valid committed, paired, confirmed correction trail. The checker therefore marks the cached correction **not effective**, reverts to the preserved original verdict `inconclusive`, and separately signals that this original inconclusive verdict is older than the six-hour reporting deadline. These are procedural/accountability signals, not findings of neglect or guilt. The reported zero overdue means no sampled case lacks an initial outcome; it does not mean those original inconclusive cases have been resolved. The empty scratch agent inventory only explains `running_agents_checked: 0` and is not a live-agent audit.

## Prospective scope and limits

The guard changes prospective correction enforcement: each frozen sample is given one durable cycle identity, repeat dispatches of that sample do not create another correction slot, and report calls enforce the cycle plus per-case serialization and Git anchoring. It does **not** retroactively settle the validity or timeliness of the two historical corrections, rewrite their evidence, or independently verify their substance. `AUDIT-CYCLE-IDENTITY.md` explicitly characterizes the guard as prospective and leaves those historical questions to the separate matter.

This report makes no determination whether either historical correction exceeded the lawful six-hour cycle. That statutory interpretation is assigned separately to `c1a00005`. Tests are hermetic/script-level evidence and do not establish a live concurrent Judiciary deployment or real board dispatch behavior. No case outcomes or correction logs were modified; no external issue action was taken. Existing Act 19 and Act 22 reports remain untouched.
