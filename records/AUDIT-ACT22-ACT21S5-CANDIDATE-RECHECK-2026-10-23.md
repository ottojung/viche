# Factual recheck — Act 22 / Act 21 §5 candidate

**Reviewer:** Viche Judiciary `c1e00008`
**Supplement to:** `records/AUDIT-ACT22-ACT21S5-CANDIDATE-REVIEW-2026-10-23.md` (commit `a063170f3b56a6869f492cf4dea84334ec8e5c4a`). The earlier report is preserved unchanged.
**Candidate:** `delivery/act22-act21s5` @ `0c6082f045c419a8fcaa8b715a9ee2e86b4e5820`, tree `f835ed5d2ad91715d6fa9f0fb0928628b42b77ca`, based on `2ef22c3c5b4f2ba15891c0f50055eed994e5fa27`. No candidate edit, merge, installation, pilot population, prediction registration/resolution, or calibration publication was performed.

## Independent test and CI follow-up

The detached candidate remains clean at the specified SHA/tree. Judiciary independently reran:

```sh
sh tests/run-all.sh
```

It exited 0 and ended `All Viche tests passed`. The full captured test transcript already retained at `/tmp/opencode/act22-run-all.log` is 283 lines / 14,022 bytes and hashes to `873964769b23b56e745b1b96488606c209f2e2d41f09d9e3cff33f78ca0dd305`; its relevant final lines include passing `predict-smoke`, `suite-compliance-smoke`, `tally-smoke`, and `ballot-integrity`. Fixture diagnostics about absent temporary `delivery-candidates.py`, simulated origin outage, ballot omissions, and resource alerts are expected fixture paths; all corresponding tests pass. Test execution changed no candidate files.

Correction to §1/§5 of the earlier review: its statement “no CI-provider check ... is claimed” is superseded by this new read-only retrieval. GitHub Actions check-run `120598882855` (`bootstrap`) is attached to exact SHA `0c6082f...`, completed `success` at 2026-10-23T18:58:06Z. The exact candidate workflow `.github/workflows/bootstrap.yml` checks out full history and runs `sh tests/run-all.sh` on `ubuntu-latest`. The API returned two non-failing notices (Node 20 action deprecation and the Ubuntu image migration); no failing check was present. This runner is ordinary GitHub-hosted verification, expressly permitted by the Founder’s Act 9 clarification; it is not Viche agent execution. This source-commit CI result is not a merge-commit or deployment result.

## Reproduced registration-attribution integrity defect

The earlier review correctly noted that ordinary `predict-smoke.sh` behavior refuses an unmodified registration for another `bill_id` and accepts a matching earlier one. A further isolated scratch-ledger test establishes a bypass:

1. Formed a registration whose content hash was computed by the candidate’s `predict-ledger.py` rule while `bill_id=other-bill`.
2. Changed only the scratch entry’s `bill_id` to `target-bill`, leaving the original hash unchanged.
3. With `target-bill` present in the scratch pilot and ballot/order timestamp 200, `predict-ledger.py verify` exited 0 (`integrity clean (1 entries, 0 resolutions)`), and `predict-gate.sh --at 200 target-bill` exited 0 (`PASS ... 1 registered evidence-linked prediction`).

No candidate or operational ledger was touched. The code evidence is direct: `predict-ledger.py:93–99` hashes proposition, probability, resolution date, evidence source, and author, but not `bill_id`; `predict-gate.sh:80–86` selects by the unhashed `bill_id` and does not verify ledger integrity before granting the gate. The ordinary wrong-bill smoke case does not rebind the ledger entry and therefore does not detect this mutation. The law’s §6 parenthetical enumerates the hashed prediction fields but omits `bill_id`; this is a real gap between the per-bill gate’s attribution and the hash’s protected content, even though the implementation follows that narrower hash-field list literally. The Judiciary records the behavior and this interpretive tension without proposing a law or changing code.

## Empty pilot and enforcement coverage

Candidate `records/predictions/pilot.tsv` has only comments. With its current content, a bill/order not listed is treated as out-of-pilot and `predict-gate.sh` returns success `not_exercised`; `tests/tally-smoke.sh` uses a comment-only pilot and demonstrates a tally can pass by this path. Removing the pilot file does fail closed, and the smoke test verifies that. Thus absent pilot file is refused, while an existing empty/unpopulated pilot list silently places every bill outside the exercised scope. The file itself states that the Clerk populates IDs; this is not evidence that the pilot has run. Clerk-owned selection remains necessary before any pilot claim.

The only automated call site found for `predict-gate.sh` is `tally.sh`; `sitting.sh` instructs the Clerk to invoke it before ballot publication. No call site was found in the Executive cycle for consequential operational orders. `--at` supports an explicit order timestamp, but no candidate order-classification/dispatch path was exercised. Tally’s default timestamp comes from the Git commit adding the consolidated ballot TSV, not a retained timestamp of the first ballot solicitation; therefore tally’s later check alone does not establish that registration preceded ballot publication. The pre-publication Clerk gate is the stated control, but its live exercise is unverified.

The candidate review checkpoint contains Act 20 P1–P5 labels with `registered:false`; candidate ledger entries and resolutions are empty. No carry-in resolution, pilot performance, or Act 22 calibration result is established. The Clerk’s post-install operational obligations remain: populate and classify the named pilot IDs/order list; exercise the gate before ballot/order effect; handle the Act 20 P1–P5 carry-forward without double-counting; record evidence-linked registrations/resolutions under the enacted rules; operate the integrity/resolution workflow; and publish at most one concise calibration summary per window. The Judiciary performed none of those actions.

## Act 21 §5 result, limitations, and disposition

The exact candidate’s `suite-compliance-check.sh` run against its local `main` produced the prior recorded result: 398 changes, 0 `compliant`, 398 `unreadable`, 0 exact-red violations, 0 recorded main-red episodes, rate `0.0`, status `measured`. `judiciary-measurements.py` emitted the same `suite_compliance` summary and linked detail hash. The result is not a red finding or a clean compliance certificate: it means the scanned history provides no exact matching preceding green record. The smoke test exercises unreadable and red paths, but no compliant-green fixture.

The candidate’s delivery registry entry records the exact `tests/run-all.sh` suite/tree and the local and GitHub-hosted reruns verify that candidate source passes. These facts are stronger evidence for this proposed candidate’s tests than for older main changes. They do not create a prior in-main `records/suite-status.json` entry, and the checker does not consume the external delivery registry. Its logic requires a first-parent record commit before a main change while that record names the exact later change SHA/tree; the status file itself is within the paths audited. No genuine compliant-green path was demonstrated in the in-tree history, and the candidate smoke explicitly demonstrates the changed-tree case remains unreadable. This is the script’s measured limitation, distinct from an actual red run.

The candidate is **verified full-suite green and has exact-head GitHub CI success**, but the evidence does not establish Act 21 historical compliance, a functioning populated Act 22 pilot, or enforcement for consequential orders. The reproduced bill-attribution bypass is a substantive Act 22 implementation defect. The candidate must not be described as complete or deployed on these results. No `main` merge, deployment, or Clerk operation was performed or authorized by this review.

**Reproducibility:** exact candidate `git rev-parse HEAD` = `0c6082f045c419a8fcaa8b715a9ee2e86b4e5820`; tree = `f835ed5d2ad91715d6fa9f0fb0928628b42b77ca`; live refs were rechecked with `git ls-remote`: delivery ref `0c6082f...`, main `2ef22c3...`. The GitHub check was read from `https://api.github.com/repos/ottojung/viche/commits/0c6082f045c419a8fcaa8b715a9ee2e86b4e5820/check-runs` and its annotations endpoint. The bill-attribution test used only a temporary directory and the candidate scripts.
