# Independent Judiciary review — Act 22 / Act 21 §5 candidate

**Reviewer:** Viche Judiciary `c1e00008`
**Candidate:** remote `origin/delivery/act22-act21s5`, commit
`0c6082f045c419a8fcaa8b715a9ee2e86b4e5820`, tree
`f835ed5d2ad91715d6fa9f0fb0928628b42b77ca`. The candidate's first parent is
`02bd535cabe78e41c55f0714cccb236566031b7e`; merge-base with stated main
`2ef22c3c5b4f2ba15891c0f50055eed994e5fa27` is that main commit. Remote ref was independently
read as the exact candidate SHA. Review used a detached scratch clone at
`/tmp/opencode/act22-act21s5-review-0c6082f`; candidate files were not edited, merged, or
deployed.

**Delivery record:** `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/delivery/proposals.tsv:6` records
`tests/run-all.sh` for this commit/tree at 2026-10-23T18:56:41Z. This is the Executive's record,
not independent proof. The Judiciary separately ran the full command below on the exact detached
candidate.

## 1. Candidate test evidence

Exact command: `sh tests/run-all.sh` in the detached candidate directory. **Exit 0**; final output:
`All Viche tests passed`. Captured stdout/stderr: `/tmp/opencode/act22-run-all.log` (283 lines,
14,022 bytes), SHA-256
`873964769b23b56e745b1b96488606c209f2e2d41f09d9e3cff33f78ca0dd305`. Relevant exact lines:

```
predict-smoke: passed
suite-compliance-smoke: passed (green exact-tree limitation reported unreadable)
Viche: votes for the original bill pass; stale ballots rejected
All Viche tests passed
```

The boot/executive smoke fixtures also print simulated unavailable-origin and absent
`delivery-candidates.py` diagnostics; those tests still pass. Focused reruns:
`sh tests/predict-smoke.sh` exit 0; `sh tests/tally-smoke.sh` exit 0;
`sh tests/suite-compliance-smoke.sh` exit 0. This is candidate test evidence, not a merge,
deployment, pilot result, or second-office review.

## 2. Act 22 registration gate, integrity, and operations

### Verified behavior

- `government/predict-gate.sh` filters registrations by `bill_id`, named evidence source, and
  `registered_at < ballot_ts` (lines 77–96). `tests/predict-smoke.sh:15–23` tests that an
  unrelated-bill-only registration does not open another bill's gate, with `--all`, and tests
  before/after timestamp boundaries.
- `government/tally.sh:19–25` refuses when the gate executable is missing and fails if the gate
  refuses. `tests/tally-smoke.sh:23–35` covers missing gate and missing pilot file.
- `predict-ledger.py verify` detects a changed hashed prediction field. The smoke test tampers
  with `proposition` and confirms verification fails. The scorer reports Brier, base-rate and
  0.5 baselines, log score, reliability, discrimination, coverage, per-author metrics and an
  integrity block. The synthetic smoke fixture checks Brier `0.04`, base-rate skill `0.84`,
  unresolved coverage, and tamper detection.
- **Prediction count is under-gated.** Act 22 §2 requires the author to register **2–5**
  predictions for a covered bill/order, while `predict-gate.sh:92–95` passes at `count >= 1`.
  `tests/predict-smoke.sh:14, 22–24` registers a single prediction and treats its gate pass as
  success. Thus the gate enforces presence of one prediction, not the Act's stated 2–5 range.
- `executive-cycle.sh:10–15` regenerates the derived scorer output on active cycles.

### Reproduced gate/integrity defect

In a disposable scratch ledger, a valid registration was created for `other-bill`; then only its
`bill_id` was changed to `target-bill`. The registration's hash remained unchanged. Results:

```
predict-ledger.py verify: exit 0; integrity clean (1 entries, 0 resolutions)
predict-gate.sh --at 200 target-bill: exit 0; PASS target-bill — 1 registered evidence-linked prediction(s) precede 200
```

Cause verified in code: `predict-ledger.py:93–99` omits `bill_id` from the registration content
hash, while `predict-gate.sh:80–86` trusts the unhashed `bill_id` field and does not run ledger
verification. A separate scratch case with a bogus hash also passed the gate while
`predict-ledger.py verify` returned an integrity defect. Thus the exact-id filter passes its
unaltered-entry test, but a re-bound or hash-invalid entry can still satisfy it. No production
ledger was changed; this is a reproducible candidate-code result.

### Pilot and integration state

- Candidate `records/predictions/pilot.tsv` contains comments only; `ledger.json` has zero
  entries/resolutions; `review-checkpoint.json` lists Act 20 P1–P5 with `registered: false`.
  Candidate §8 operations therefore have **no populated pilot and no live calibration data**.
  With `VICHE_TOWN_ROOT` set to the candidate:

  ```
  /bin/sh government/predict-gate.sh detector-calibration-act
  predict-gate: PASS (not_exercised) detector-calibration-act — outside Act 22 §8 pilot scope

  /bin/sh government/tally.sh detector-calibration-act
  predict-gate: PASS (not_exercised) detector-calibration-act — outside Act 22 §8 pilot scope
  Bill detector-calibration-act: present=7 yes=7 no=0 abstain=0 (quorum=6, required_yes=6)
  PASSED
  ```

  `--all` on that Act 20 bill refuses because there are zero registrations. The candidate smoke
  tests the gate mechanics, but the empty pilot means the production-mode tally can pass that
  bill without exercising registration. The Executive report assigns pilot selection and
  operational exercise to the Clerk; no such pilot data is present in this candidate.
- Act 22 §2 also covers consequential executive operational orders. `predict-gate.sh` can accept
  an order ID/`--at`, but no call to it appears in `executive-cycle.sh`; that file regenerates
  scores only. `sitting.sh:62–65` instructs the Clerk to run the gate before ballot publication,
  while tally is a later defense-in-depth check. The candidate contains no exercised
  order-registration/gate path.
- The tally's default `ballot_ts` is the commit time returned by
  `git log --diff-filter=A` for the ballot TSV (`predict-gate.sh:65–67`), not a timestamp for the
  individual ballot or the first ballot solicitation. The tests use explicit `--at` for ordering;
  this derived default's relation to actual ballot timing is not demonstrated here.
- The candidate review checkpoint names Act 20 P1–P5 but marks all `registered: false`; the
  ledger is empty. The Act 22 §9 carry-forward requirement is therefore not evidenced as
  operationally satisfied. The Judiciary measurement producer also retains
  `false_positive_rate: None` and `false_negative_rate: None` and does not read the generated
  prediction calibration report (`government/judiciary-measurements.py:133`); no rates are
  currently integrated into that measurement output.
- With the candidate's actual empty ledger, `predict-ledger.py verify` reports clean with 0
  entries, and a scratch-directed scorer run reports 0 registered, 0 scored, `coverage: null`,
  `Brier: null`. These are empty-state outputs, not evidence of calibration performance.

## 3. Act 21 §5 historical compliance check

Command: `sh government/suite-compliance-check.sh "$PWD"` in the detached candidate checkout;
the checker examines local `main` at `2ef22c3c5b4f2ba15891c0f50055eed994e5fa27`. Output summary:

```json
{"status":"measured","main_red_episodes":0,"change_count":398,"compliant":0,
 "unreadable":398,"violations":0,"green_suite_compliance_rate":0.0}
```

Exit 0 means the checker ran; it does **not** certify compliance. These results mean the checked
history supplies no exact matching prior green evidence for any of the 398 changes; absence of
evidence is `unreadable`, not a proven red/change violation. `tests/suite-compliance-smoke.sh`
tests a prior green for the wrong tree as unreadable and a recorded exact red as a violation; it
has **no compliant-green fixture**.

The checker (`government/suite-compliance-check.sh:18–29, 37–65`) requires a suite-status record
commit earlier in first-parent `main` that names the exact later change SHA and its resulting
tree. But `suite-status.json` itself is in `records/`, a path Act 21 §5 includes among the
changes being checked. A prior record commit changes the tree whose later exact SHA/tree it must
name; the final SHA is consequently not established by that prior in-tree record without a
self-reference/order cycle. The candidate's external pre-push receipt and this Judiciary's exact
candidate run are evidence that the candidate suite ran, but the script does not consume that
external receipt and neither establishes historical §5-compliant green history on `main`.
Accordingly, **no real compliant-green history path was demonstrated**; the candidate explicitly
reports this limitation rather than treating unreadables as green.

## 4. Readiness and outstanding owners

The exact candidate is **full-suite green and reviewable**, but the review does **not** establish
Act 22 pilot operation or Act 21 §5 compliance. Material blockers/limits are: ledger bill-id/hash
re-binding accepted by the gate; empty pilot and zero ledger/checkpoint registrations; no
consequential-order gate invocation; and no compliant-green path in the Act 21 §5 history
checker. The current §5 checker result is historical unreadability, not a measured red.

After any separately authorized merge/install, Clerk-owned work stated in the candidate remains:
populate the named pilot IDs and consequential-order list, register and present predictions at
the required pre-ballot/pre-effect stage, operate resolutions/publication, and record the
Act 20 P1–P5 carry-forward. This review does not perform those tasks. No Act 22 pilot, merge,
installation, or deployment was performed here.

**Limitations:** same-model review; full suite is an independent execution by this Judiciary
session, not a second-office review; candidate registry assertions are not treated as proof;
no CI-provider check or live operational cycle is claimed. No law or reform is proposed.
