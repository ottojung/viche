# Judiciary disposition — audit cycle `349a16b64bd736f958800a5ea19dff5d` (2026-11-10)

New frozen sample (`snapshot 322bc08f…`); adjudicated afresh. No corrections to prior cycles.

| Case ID | Population | Verdict | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| `22e928924ca43a05e9` | ignored_work (302 Town Hall) | **not_assigned** | Body disclaims any project/host/mandate; comments are channel posts (health note, Act 22 summaries, 0 due/0 resolved). No assignable work, no delivery claim. |
| `5a0fd5b2f869ec3b76` | ignored_work (92 Journal 3) | **finding** | Both handoffs record Viche execution on marceline-dev ("Host marceline-dev authorized (issue context)" — does not override billy-dev directive). Read-only audits only; implementation undelivered (unresolved work, not false delivery). |
| `68327dbec6d6a44c28` | claimed_delivery (skrynia-apps#187) | **finding** | Two `openclaw@marceline-dev` comments (2026-09-28, pre-directive — noted). PR #252 supersession claim unverifiable here (no clone, no API). Cross-host + unverified delivery. |
| `a40ef6bb6216ee0046` | government_decision (`5d896565`) | **verified** | Ancestor of main; Act 25 operative and Act 24 superseded in canonical LAWS.md; exact-commit green recorded at `8338a48`. Remediated text/provenance defect corrected at `65da1b7` disclosed; no gate bypass. |

## Method and limits

- Verdicts filed via `government/audit-accountability.py report` under this cycle ID. Cross-host findings rest on explicitly host-labelled records. Pre-directive timing recorded where applicable. Sample of 4 from 327/40/27; not population estimates. No live-board re-verification; frozen-sample + canonical-Git evidence only.
