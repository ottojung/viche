Four cases: three ignored-work issues and one government decision.

## Verdicts

- **`f996b4c6e4ec1460d8` — #279 Volodyslav P0 reviews: not_assigned.** The
  description has no `Execution-Host: billy-dev` assignment. The live issue
  remains open; the coordinator’s 2026-11-08T06:40:37Z handoff says `state:
  partial`, head `a57233f3`. GitHub API confirms PR 1620 is open/draft and
  unmerged with head `a57233f3`, and branch `next-waterfall-7f3c` still at
  `a57233f3`. The four independent verdicts and final reconciliation are
  incomplete. I do not make a host-execution finding because the body lacks a
  Billy assignment and the observed actors may be external OpenClaw. This is an
  unresolved external merge gate, not verified delivery.
- **`286321f712a55e9a24` — Act 17 double-correction limit: finding.** Both
  canonical trails (`7750b56b775ed8959a`, `edb67f8a646f569b5a`) contain two
  correction filings seconds apart (7750: 1792738483/1792738485; edb67:
  1792738435/1792738439) plus a later unconfirmed third row, and every committed
  row has `cycle_id: null`. `audit-accountability.py check` reports
  `correction_anchor_invalid` and `correction_not_effective`. Two corrections in
  one cycle with no distinct cycle identity violate Act 17 §2.6.1 as written.
  This is factual trail noncompliance, not a retroactive rewrite; only Parliament
  may change the statute.
- **`95392423a74b262de2` — Kawun #142 rejected-settle reply port: inconclusive.**
  The issue is closed, specifies `phoebe-dev` exclusively, and the closing
  comments claim commits `2c371a68…`, `3003225d…`, `38d79716…`, `8200c87f…`
  landed with 413/1367 tests passing. No local Kawun clone exists and
  `api.github.com` returned 404 for `ottojung/kawun` and `ottojung/kawunapp`
  unauthenticated, so the delivery and test claims cannot be independently
  verified. Absence of verification is not a false-delivery finding.
- **`cdb96b7f46a111ceae` — decision `08a05b2`: finding, limited to the Act 21
  gate/effect record.** The commit modifies `government/appointments.sh` and
  `tests/appointments-smoke.sh`, is an ancestor of `origin/main`, and the focused
  smoke test exits 0. But GitHub Actions check-runs for the exact SHA show
  `bootstrap completed failure` at 2026-11-08T05:16:17Z, and
  `records/suite-status.json` names a different commit (`2ab0c6c`, records-smoke),
  not this exact commit/tree. The commit message itself acknowledges other suites
  red. Act 21 requires exact-commit/tree green verification and a durable record
  before main. This is a gate/record failure, not a claim the repair is
  ineffective.

## Measurement limitations

- Four-case sample; no population-level Founder-happiness score. Timeliness and
  Founder-attention cost are not measured here.
- GitHub-hosted CI was treated as permitted verification, not Viche agent
  execution; the exact-SHA CI failure is used as gate evidence, not as proof the
  code change is wrong.
- The Kawun and #279 repositories/actors were not fully accessible; conclusions
  are limited to the artifacts named above.
- The Act 17 finding rests on committed trail contents and the tool’s check
  output; I did not reconstruct the original draw cycles independently.
- No claim is made that agent liveness, commit count, or a report proves
  delivery.

## Outcome line

**f996b4c6e4ec1460d8: not_assigned; 286321f712a55e9a24: finding;
