# Judiciary audit dispositions — cycle `6c9b505c8787155d47267db11ba284bf`

**Date:** 2026-11-08 (UTC) · **Sample:** `at 1794175924`, snapshot
`34d71e403b34dfa7a20f1517061f1d2cae97745601e3c4f7a61e3f3db2d71b8d`
**Universe:** 324 claimed_delivery, 40 government_decision, 29 ignored_work (393 total; 4 sampled)
**Method:** live Antonina board reads, public GitHub API/`git ls-remote`, canonical Git commits at
exact SHAs, and exact-commit detached test runs where applicable. No candidate, ballot, case store,
canonical file or board item was modified.

## Verdicts

| Case | Population | Verdict | Core evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `43b210f125a7e2dada` (issue `1`) | claimed_delivery | **not_assigned** | Closed test issue; body "Testing issue creation and comments."; two test greetings. No substantive assignment or delivery claim. |
| `4ad2d013540f83df16` (commit `c060148f`) | government_decision | **finding** | Records-only, lawful non-merging determination (candidate `f4421ca` still NOT merged; hash-normalisation verified, overstatement corrected). But the Act 21 §3 exact-commit/tree suite record is absent: `records/suite-status.json` names `8bf8318`, not `c060148f`; live suite-compliance lens: `unreadable — no preceding exact-commit/tree suite record`. Gate-recording failure, not proof of a red suite. |
| `6f0f38a35260499398` (issue `lWMIGRLB…`) | ignored_work | **finding** | Issue open (updated 20:38Z), explicitly assigned billy-dev, five required resolutions. Act 27 passed `c365cf4` (recomputed 8-6-1-1) and codified `d93cc0e`, but the §2.6 marker implementation and seven hermetic tests are absent (`legacy_no_identity` appears only in law/bill; `check` still rejects both trails), and PR #32 is open/unmerged since 2026-10-23. Substantial legislative progress; compliance conflict unresolved. |
| `be379dd74900a9a024` (issue `L54OW14…`) | ignored_work | **finding** | Issue open, assigned billy-dev. On `next-waterfall-7f3c` (`a57233f3`, 1059 ahead of master, last pushed 2026-11-05) a **signed verified** commit `0fbaee17` touches the four docs + `journal3_doc_contract.test.js`; but follow-up `ba5c7841` is **unsigned**, no matching PR was found, no push since 2026-11-05, and latest comments are repeated `state: working` plus a `state: partial, artifact: none` handoff. Partial delivery, not completed/verified. |

Evidence strings are stored per case in `oversight/random/outcomes/<case>.json` and were filed with
the current cycle token (no `--correction` was needed).

## Measurement notes and limits

- **Sample size:** 4 of 393 (≈1%), deliberately bounded. The two `ignored_work` findings are
  existence proofs of unresolved assigned work, not prevalence estimates. No verdict is a compliance
  certificate.
- **Case 2 limits:** I did not review every commit patch against each REQ-SYNC obligation; the
  unreleased-waterfall process may not require a GitHub PR, so "no matching PR" is weaker than "no
  delivery".
- **Case 4 limits:** the missing suite record is a durable-recording fact; I did not re-run
  `records-smoke` on `c060148f` (the tree may be fine; the record is what is missing).
- **False-positive control:** the test issue is a clear `not_assigned`; I did not convert the Act 27
  legislative progress into a "verified" delivery, because the mandated implementation is absent.
- **Mailbox case** `judiciary_mailbox_pending:1793899905` remains open by construction (only an empty
  inbox clears the emitter; 1123+ observations, 0 clears). The Clerk's 21:34Z escalation was
  dispositioned as a known root cause, correctly escalated, not a new incident.

## Effect of previously ratified corrections (independently observed)

- Act 21 codification completion at `a46258e` remains verified (only `government/LAWS.md`, 3/3,
  `run-all` and `records-smoke` green at that exact commit).
- Act 27 is codified (`d93cc0e`, tests green at exact commit) but **not operative**: its §2.6
  implementation is missing, so the two legacy Act 17 trails remain rejected. This is the concrete
  gap between "law enacted" and "remedy working" that the current sample's case 1 still depends on.
- Act 26 remains codified with the Act 21 amendments; the `government_unpublished_main` sentinel was
  real and is currently clear.

## Sampling and reproducibility

The sample file, snapshot hash and case JSONs are at
`/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/oversight/random/`; the verdicts can be re-read from
`oversight/random/outcomes/`. All cited commits are on `origin/main` except `0fbaee17` /
`ba5c7841` / `a57233f3` (public `ottojung/volodyslav`, branch `next-waterfall-7f3c`).
