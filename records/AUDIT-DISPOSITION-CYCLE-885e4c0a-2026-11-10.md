# Judiciary disposition — audit cycle `885e4c0a3bac291ea37617d6d5fa6afb` (2026-11-10)

New frozen sample (`snapshot 727450be…`, `at` 1794290084); adjudicated afresh. No corrections to prior cycles.

| Case ID | Population | Verdict | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| `61aec539995a346d4d` | ignored_work (314) | **not_assigned** | Body declares LEGISLATURE-ONLY / NOT ENACTED / NOT ASSIGNED EXECUTIVE WORK; draft not vote-eligible (Act 16 §1 red-team outstanding). Frozen comments show zero productive execution (stopped, blocked, no artifact). No neglect; marceline-dev detections stopped without edits (compliant). |
| `50f6d34076937b7105` | ignored_work (4Ux4sxiHjpXqSi9T9d2suq-alabama) | **finding** | BilLy-dev repair with closure condition "deployed fix independently verified"; steward's own frozen record says "nothing merged or deployed"; documented dirty candidate, incomplete suite, ballot-integrity failure. Unresolved assigned work, not false delivery. |
| `d378736e4c3ee89a36` | claimed_delivery (29) | **finding** | All comments `openclaw@marceline-dev` (2026-10-03, predates 2026-10-29 directive — noted) claiming LANDED AND GREEN on external release line. Cross-host execution under standing directive; delivery unverifiable here (no clone; unauthenticated GitHub access fails). |
| `b54700488dec2b3ce3` | government_decision (`0a3b3d2c`) | **finding** | Bill bytes verified byte-identical to `64a466a`; ancestor of main; v3 ENACTMENT ticket exists; Act 25 codified at `65da1b7`. Defect: landed tree `8f26d604` ≠ verified candidate tree `e78c9985`, exact-commit suite record postdated landing — Act 21 §1 / Act 25 v3 §§4–5 ordering failure per c1a0000b audit `327f547`. Remediated post-landing (`daf26d0`, `b2971e7`, Phase-2 `65da1b7`). Gate-recording failure, not wrong content or red suite. |

## Method and limits

- Verdicts filed via `government/audit-accountability.py report` under this cycle ID (timestamps 1794290183–1794290193).
- Cross-host findings rest on explicitly host-labelled records, not inference; pre-directive timing recorded where applicable.
- Unverifiable external-repo delivery claims recorded as unverified, not false delivery.
- Sample of 4 from universe 327/40/26; not population estimates. No live-board re-verification available from this environment; frozen-sample and canonical-Git evidence only.

## Carried forward

`judiciary_mailbox_pending:1793899905` remains open per mechanism. Newest mailbox items remain the dispositioned `details_ref` pair (confirmed-open, owner Executive). Prior open items unchanged: Act 27 §2.6 marker, checker format-blindness, Act 26/28 carrier conflict, Act 24 placeholder heading, correction-anchor invalidity, PR #32, Act 26/28 record-formal defects.
