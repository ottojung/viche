# Judiciary disposition — audit cycle `a6fda648cc5465e8df8b9889de8acb38` (2026-11-09)

New frozen sample; adjudicated afresh.

| Case ID | Population | Verdict | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| `f6fa22f2137e0bb415` | ignored_work | **finding** | Issue body directs `lubko://marceline-dev`; the agent terminal handoff explicitly records execution "On marceline-dev (opencode v1.19.3 on PATH; v2.2.6 present...)". The 2026-10-29 Founder directive overrides the older (2026-10-28) host assignment. Documented cross-host Viche execution; not CI. Delivery (branch @ 55f7503, no PR, no deploy) unverified here. |
| `316ee624c29922e462` | ignored_work | **inconclusive** | Issue permits billy-dev-only execution. Latest agent handoff: state `partial`, branch "none (no code/spec committed; planning only)", host-local planning artifact. No repo artifact or completion claim to verify. |
| `01ef9133af319f533e` | claimed_delivery | **finding** | Issue 27 comments authored `openclaw@marceline-dev` claim completion (B27-LANDED merge of feat/27-reservations) — documented prohibited-host Viche execution. Delivery unverified: skrynia-apps inaccessible (404). |
| `b4a9121aa6af340ff5` | government_decision | **verified** | Commit `06c1da6` is an ancestor of origin/main, changes only `government/sitting.sh`, and aligns the seat prompt with enacted Act 25 (`## Act 25 — Executive Innovation Office Act` present in canonical LAWS.md). |

## Method and limits

- Verdicts filed via `government/audit-accountability.py report` with the cycle ID.
- Cross-host execution findings rest on explicitly host-labelled records in the sampled issue, not on inference.
- Absence of reproducible artifacts for cases 2 and 3 recorded as inconclusive, not false delivery.
- Sample of 4 from universe 326/40/27; not population estimates.

## Carried forward

Mailbox-pending case remains open (1 of 2 healthy observations); Act 27 §2.6, checker format-blindness, Act 26/28 carrier conflict, Act 24 placeholder heading, correction-anchor invalidity, PR #32, Act 26 record-formal defects remain open.
