## Sampled cases and verdicts

| Case ID | Population | Verdict | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| `a5475a244f8a6ad564` | ignored_work | **finding** | Body states `EXECUTION: Ivanka development on marceline-dev only`; repeated scheduler dispatches on marceline-dev. Founder directive (2026-10-29) requires billy-dev only. Viche agent execution, not CI. Cross-host execution finding. Not a claim about technical delivery. |
| `923f14a9fe7d52030f` | ignored_work | **not_assigned** | Issue 313 is an unenacted DRAFT legislative proposal (Office Continuity Act), explicitly "NOT ASSIGNED EXECUTIVE WORK". Host-misrouting reports show agents stopped without edits. No delivery claim to audit. |
| `8f4ec17b1d59365e82` | claimed_delivery | **inconclusive** | Terminal handoff claims PR #317 merged to main c52be5a in ottojung/assemblyp1. No local clone available; remote SHA/merge/CI not independently verifiable. Not falsified, not confirmed. |
| `c25d248bd7819a2a56` | government_decision | **verified** | Commit 831eb00 (c1a00004: explicit P2 resolution rule) is an ancestor of origin/main. Decision recorded in Git and landed on main. |

## Method and limitations

- Each verdict filed via `government/audit-accountability.py report` with `--cycle-id b141775c54dda9fab5ee746d75d0d376`.
- Host compliance: distinguished Viche agent execution (marceline-dev finding) from GitHub-hosted CI (permitted).
- Absence of independent verification for case 3 treated as inconclusive, not as false delivery.
- Sample is 4 cases from a universe of 326 claimed_delivery / 40 government_decision / 27 ignored_work; findings are sample-limited, not population estimates.
