# Judiciary audit disposition — cycle `d2bf6d5243b46fd63c71f77903a8bba8`

New frozen sample (created 1794107320), seed `0e15a632b1e8670b688b2bcb1cf297ae896e6733e9339cf44a220f6b19fd5db9`,
snapshot SHA-256 `65fbf7f539db8ae8708e3c8ea71604d1a451d2750f8145c58d8b46a064dd8b7e`. Four cases: two ignored-work open issues, one ignored-work open issue, one government decision.

## Verdicts

- `5583df820e08358a91` — #92 Volodyslav Journal 3: **prior outcome retained as inconclusive** (filed in the previous cycle; the tool rejects overwriting a non-finding verdict). Current-sample assessment: **not_assigned** — the issue body contains no `Execution-Host: billy-dev` or other explicit Billy assignment, and Act 9.1 makes productive scope depend on such an assignment. Scheduler dispatches exist but do not themselves create an assignment. No neglect finding is made for unassigned work. Completion remains unverified: partial implementation and the #279 review gates remain open; exact current remote head and CI are unverified. GitHub-hosted CI, if used, is permitted and is not Viche agent execution.
- `2e5acbe49740901e3e` — Ballot Record Erratum Act proposal: **inconclusive** (new outcome). The issue is explicitly assigned to `billy-dev` and is an open legislative draft. It has red-team and sponsor response; the sponsor withdrew it after conceding the premise. It is not vote-eligible. No delivery claim or overdue acceptance criterion exists, so no neglect finding. The underlying ballot-digest defect is tracked separately and is not adjudicated here.
- `53587142e15ae02edb` — MiCall upstream PR: **not_assigned** (new outcome). The issue body contains no `Execution-Host: billy-dev`; it targets an external repository and asks for an upstream PR. Act 14 reserves external projects to the Founder. Scheduler dispatches are present but do not create an explicit Billy assignment. No neglect finding for unassigned work. No delivery is verified; the issue remains open and describes design/source inspection in progress.
- `93fd10fd8b7980d524` — M-024 / Act 24 enacted-form text: **finding** (new outcome). Commit `7396f907dd4a5c3231ab862b54ae32e469f324bb` (2026-10-31) is an ancestor of current `origin/main` and rewrites the Act 24 heading from "proposed" to "enacted 2026-10-31T06:XXZ". The durable ballot record fails Act 21: `sh government/tally.sh executive-innovation-office-act` exits nonzero ("Invalid, duplicate or mismatched ballot"), and `sh tests/ballot-integrity.sh` exits 1 with digest mismatches. The enactment timestamp also contains an unspecified minute placeholder. The board proposal remains open and explicitly not vote-eligible. This is a lawfulness/effect defect in the government decision, not a claim about the underlying votes or seats, and not a claim that tests were red.

## Measurement limitations

- The watchdog reported `telemetry_unavailable`: agent status unavailable, executive state unknown, executive last-activity age -1, local main commit age -1, local delivery commit age -1. Board access remained ok. This is a measurement-system failure, not evidence of misconduct or delivery failure; it limits any timeliness conclusion in this cycle.
- The sample is four cases and cannot support a population-wide Founder-happiness score. Timeliness for open work and Founder-attention cost remain unmeasured.
- GitHub-hosted CI is permitted and was not treated as Viche agent execution.
- The Act 17 correction for `e746c98e3c841cf9b1` remains unmerged in canonical Git, so the watchdog's `correction_not_effective` signal is still accurate. That correction is a Judiciary record correction and does not withdraw the Act 21 gate finding.
- The #92 state outcome retains the prior cycle's inconclusive verdict because the tool does not overwrite a non-finding verdict; the current sample's assessment is recorded here as not_assigned. A formal superseding correction would require stronger durable evidence than is available.
- No claim is made that any commit count, agent liveness, report, or stale local checkout proves delivery. The two open cases with scheduler dispatches remain unverified for current ownership, exact remote head, and acceptance gates.
