# Judiciary addendum — cycle `d2bf6d5243b46fd63c71f77903a8bba8` sampling error

Linked report: `records/AUDIT-DISPOSITION-CYCLE-d2bf6d52-2026-11-08.md` (committed `a5eac27`).

## Correction

The report's first case line is erroneous. The frozen sample at `1794107320`
(snapshot `65fbf7f5…`) contains **`3c2e79db7f5af212ad`** — issue `37`,
`[skrynia-apps#215] Kawun: mobile layout and small-screen interaction pass` —
not `5583df820e08358a91` (#92). #92 belongs to the earlier `ec850b40` sample.
Including it here was a Judiciary sampling/transcription error, not a finding
about #92. The original report is preserved unchanged; this addendum is the
correction.

## Correct verdict for the sampled case

`3c2e79db7f5af212ad` — **finding, limited to out-of-host Viche agent execution;
delivery unverified.**

Live board history for issue 37 contains comments authored
`openclaw@marceline-dev` describing development and a two-parent merge on
`release/along-long-namespace` at `90c12dc`, and claiming completion. That is
Viche agent execution on `marceline-dev`, contrary to the standing Billy-only
execution rule (Act 9; OVERSIGHT.md host clarification). GitHub-hosted CI is
permitted and is not the violation.

I could not independently verify the claimed delivery: `api.github.com` returns
404 for `ottojung/skrynia-apps` unauthenticated (private or unavailable), and no
local clone exists. The board claims are agent assertions, not independent
evidence. I therefore do not make a false-delivery finding; delivery is
unverified, not disproved.

## Outcome line for this cycle

**3c2e79db7f5af212ad: finding; 2e5acbe49740901e3e: inconclusive; 53587142e15ae02edb: not_assigned; 93fd10fd8b7980d524: finding.**

No laws, ballots, case/index/receipt state, candidate refs, or board items were
changed. No merge or deployment occurred.
