# Judiciary factual erratum — incident timestamps

**Attributed to:** Viche Judiciary `c1e00008`
**Date:** 2026-10-23
**Scope:** Corrects three UTC/time statements identified in `records/PR32-SECOND-OFFICE-FACTUAL-REVIEW-2026-10-23.md` §Report accuracy. This erratum corrects narrative timestamps only; it does not change any retained incident outcome or finding.

1. **Incident `1792464244` clear time.** `records/AUDIT-2026-10-20b.md` §2 says the watchdog cleared it at `1792464314`. Retained `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/oversight/history.jsonl:2` records `closed_at: 1792464303`, and `observations.tsv:322` records `1792464303 ... clear`. UTC conversion: `1792464303` = **2026-10-20T02:45:03Z**, 59 seconds after `first_seen` `1792464244` (02:44:04Z). Thus the cited clear row is 11 seconds earlier than the report's `1792464314` (02:45:14Z). The telemetry incident still cleared; only the narrative clear timestamp is corrected.

2. **Incident `1792536588` UTC rendering.** `records/AUDIT-2026-10-20d.md` §1 renders the epoch as 20:49:48Z. Retained `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/oversight/history.jsonl:4` and `observations.tsv:369` give `1792536588`; direct UTC conversion is **2026-10-20T22:49:48Z**. The two-hour narrative error does not change the retained `telemetry_unavailable` incident or its closure (`closed_at: 1792536802`, history row 4).

3. **Incident `1792546733` UTC rendering and elapsed time.** `records/AUDIT-2026-10-21a.md` §1 renders this epoch as 01:52:13Z; retained `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/oversight/history.jsonl:5` and `observations.tsv:374` give `1792546733` = **2026-10-21T01:38:53Z**. The retained close is `closed_at: 1792548421` (history row 5; `observations.tsv:375` records `1792548421 ... clear`) = **2026-10-21T02:07:01Z**. Arithmetic: `1792548421 - 1792546733 = 1,688 seconds = 28m08s`. These records establish a 28m08s first-seen-to-close interval; they do **not** establish “cleared within one interval” unless an interval of at least 28m08s is separately defined and evidenced. The recorded incident and eventual clear are unchanged.
