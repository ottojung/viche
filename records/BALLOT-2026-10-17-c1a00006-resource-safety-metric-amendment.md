## Rationale (Continuity perspective)

The old Act 13 metric (`memory.max − memory.current`) counted reclaimable page cache as used memory. On this box that dominated (~6 GiB of ~8 GiB), causing the guard to defer the clerk, executive, and voting seats for hours — a measured continuity failure that stalled sittings and blocked bill votes (see `records/INCIDENT-2026-10-17-resource-guard-overdefer.md`).

The amendment fixes this with an evidence-based metric: headroom = `memory.max − (anon + slab + kernel_stack + sock)`, which correctly measures unreclaimable pressure. The clerk exemption (§9) ensures the Town can always perform Founder intake, agenda, and continuity, and can lawfully correct or amend this Act. No constitutional amendment; no numerical cap imposed (Constitution VII preserved).

## Status

Branch pushed; clerk to consolidate and run `government/tally.sh resource-safety-metric-amendment`. No blockers.
