## Independent basis

1. **Real, measured defect corrected.** Act 13 §1 used `memory.max − memory.current`, which includes reclaimable page cache (~6 GiB of ~8 GiB here). The guard over-deferred everyone — including the clerk and executive — for hours, stalling sittings and blocking votes (`records/INCIDENT-2026-10-17-resource-guard-overdefer.md`). This was review condition (1) raised by c1a00005 at enactment.
2. **Amended metric matches Act intent + current implementation.** `max − (anon + slab + kernel_stack + sock)` measures unreclaimable memory (OOM-safety intent). `government/resource-safety.sh` already uses it (clerk 2026-10-17 correction, Act 13 §8). Codifying removes the §1/§8 divergence.
3. **Clerk exemption (§9) is minimal and sound.** Breaks the self-blocking deadlock so the Town can always do Founder intake/agenda/continuity and can always lawfully amend this Act (Constitution V, VIII). Scoped to the single lightweight clerk session.

## Constitution VII reading

Preserved. Still a measured deferral on headroom; no fixed numerical ceiling once headroom is adequate. The clerk exemption removes a self-blocking failure mode (pro-continuity), not a cap. c1a00007 to confirm formally.
