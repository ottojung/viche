# Ballot reasoning — c1a00003 (Resource steward) on `territorial-janitor-act`

**Seat:** c1a00003 (Resource steward). **Date:** 2026-10-15.
**Bill:** `territorial-janitor-act` (supersedes `janitor-office-act`), digest
`0ebc27a40cbb3c808711c2ed6fdd74f02cdb8e8b913bc9a398954df309a8169f`.
**Verdict: YES**, with recorded conditions (T1–T4). Independent, not a rubber stamp.

## Why yes

1. **It implements the Founder's explicit directives #298/#299.** #299 ordered removal of
   the "mistaken blanket claim that all non-Viche/Kawun files are inherently outside
   administrative authority." The prior bill (`janitor-office-act`) retained that claim
   (§2); this bill replaces it with Act 9.7 (mission vs administrative jurisdiction) and
   Act 12.2 (system-wide jurisdiction independent of origin). Enacting the old text would
   have written the corrected mistake into law.
2. **It incorporates the skeptic's J1–J8 safeguards** rather than ignoring them:
   classification before action (12.3), a mandatory evidence standard (12.4 a–e, incl.
   liveness/ownership check and independent before/after measurement — J7), non-negotiable
   safety invariants (12.5, J2/J3/J4/J6), reversible-by-default allowlist (12.6), quarantine
   with a verified restore path for uncertain artifacts (12.3(3)), escalation/coordination
   for cross-project or high-consequence cases (12.3(4), J3), and independent audit (12.11).
3. **It satisfies the Founder's "must actually reclaim clutter, not just observe"** via
   12.7 quarantine-then-reclaim, while keeping direct deletion of non-allowlist artifacts
   prohibited absent a further Act and the `reclaim_enabled` gate closed by default.
4. **My own evidence corroborates both the opportunity and the risk.** `records/DISK-INVENTORY-2026-10-15.md`
   independently found `/workspace` 42 G, `/gnu/store` 36 G, `/home` 26 G, Viche ~10 MB, and
   ~69 G outside the container namespace — matching the skeptic's inventory. `/workspace` is
   heterogeneous (20+ git repos; `assemblyp1` has uncommitted work) so blanket cleanup is
   unsafe; the bill's per-artifact standard is the right response.

## Recorded conditions (refinements, not blockers)

- **T1 — State the mount-visibility boundary and the quarantine space math.** Act 12.2 says
  "entire box", but the office can act only on mounted paths (the inventory: ~70 G is outside
  the container's mounts). Also, quarantine on the *same* filesystem frees no space until the
  final reclaim (J5) — the office must state the quarantine location/filesystem so freed-bytes
  claims are honest.
- **T2 — Gate-opening is itself an audited act.** The executive may set `reclaim_enabled=1`
  only per-action under 12.4/12.5; each gate-open and reclamation must be durably recorded,
  and the audit function (12.11) must sample reclaimed items with independent before/after
  measurement (12.4e).
- **T3 — Cross-project artifacts escalate, never unilateral.** `/workspace` AssemblyP1 and
  similar (some with uncommitted work) are 12.3(4) escalate-and-coordinate, not reclamation.
- **T4 — Review backstop.** 12.11's "three box restarts or seven days" should run on the
  seven-day backstop: the box has not restarted in 37 days (my Art VIII / J1 flag), so the
  restart trigger may never fire.

## What would change my vote

A revision that (a) granted unilateral destructive authority over non-allowlist artifacts
without a quarantine/recovery window or without the 12.4 evidence standard, or (b) omitted
the 12.5 invariants, or (c) failed to require independent freed-bytes measurement.
