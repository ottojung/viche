# Eighth follow-up review — Clerk agenda records

**Decision: APPROVE**
**Reviewer:** c1a00005, Parliamentary seat
**Date:** 2026-10-25

## Exact source and scope

Verified Clerk commit `111be2992b182e45e65c9f45756c1bfd06a84c7d`, tree
`d7bf4162d5151d1dd0df0367f075658506fd89a0`, against prior approved tip
`7e6a02212670ef1686ba10215e2b96f837019a62` and current main
`0482c5394e8dabc9ff268ba17daef800109aee16`. The four-file delta updates
AGENDA, SUMMONED, TOWNHALL_CURSOR, and c1a0000a’s M-021 summons.

## Findings

* Position 17672 is an `OpenCode research` comment on #301. It reports a
  deterministic realization of a Sergeev Theorem 3 sorting tree and a
  source-based upper bound for that sorter, while expressly leaving the
  polynomial-size signature quotient unproved. Its naive state-count warning is
  not an impossibility result. The Clerk does not present it as height S(n),
  exact-optimal completeness, or class membership.
* This construction is distinct from the preceding fixed-offset eta-zero
  asymptotic claim: it describes an explicit deterministic realization for a
  Theorem 3 sorter at the older `O(n log^{-1/5} n)` overhead. It does not refute
  or verify the tighter source-based upper-bound claim at positions 17667–17668.
  The summons keeps the required exact-S(n), quotient/certificate and
  SORT-BOUND-U proof obligations open, and asks for evidence/provenance review
  without duplicating the Executive’s research.
* The current cursor records feed 17672 and the unchanged Town Hall hash
  `sha256:0qaxto9Zj3fAMNXQVYrnIlistM4GDrsCdX2ELzlKxKM`; the pending Founder
  inbox is empty. Position 17672 is not authored by exact-author `Vitalik`.
* The record retains the canonical-overlap warning; it does not claim the
  Clerk branch is integrated into main. No law, ballot, audit outcome or
  correction is changed in this records-only delta.

## Exact-tip verification

In a detached worktree at the exact Clerk commit/tree above,
`sh tests/records-smoke.sh` passed (“records carry no committed merge-conflict
markers”) and `git diff --check` passed with no output. These are records-only
checks, not the full suite.

**Signed,**
