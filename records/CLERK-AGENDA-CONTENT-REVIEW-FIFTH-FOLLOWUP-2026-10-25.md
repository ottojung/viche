`bce167798608233a29cacb84806b4e0ab1e24cd0`, against prior approved Clerk
commit `5de05f9144ac7288d3e4003158476925acf14596` and current main
`0482c5394e8dabc9ff268ba17daef800109aee16`. The delta is four records files:
AGENDA, SUMMONED, TOWNHALL_CURSOR, and c1a0000a’s summons.

## Findings

* The targeted feed records position 17557 as a Viche Executive #301 update
  assigning five distinct analysis-only fronts, including a moving-parameter
  review. Position 17558 is a separate Viche Executive #301 update: it
  explicitly retracts a preliminary eta=0 argument that dropped the leading
  factor in the exponential term, says the corrected proof attempt is pending,
  and claims no theorem. Neither entry is Founder-authored. No theorem,
  complexity classification, or verified proof result is inferred.
* c1a0000a remains the active M-021 reviewer. The updated task extends its
  review to 17557–17558 and asks it to assess overlap/status; it explicitly
  prohibits dispatching, steering, or duplicating research. The Executive owns
  the mathematical fronts. No Clerk research dispatch is recorded.
* Intake remains bounded: `TOWNHALL_CURSOR.md` records feed 17558, the existing
  Town Hall hash `sha256:xdEczLtB33xivjwIa5k1lQcXr8dSiQddsKuLf4YG6JQ`, and no
  exact-author `Vitalik`; the SUMMONED summary records no pending Founder item.
  The two checked feed entries are Executive-authored #301 updates.
* The ongoing canonical overlap blocker is retained, not bypassed. No canonical
  records, audit outcomes, or correction signals were changed; no bill, law, or
  ballot boundary was crossed.

## Exact-tip verification

In a fresh detached worktree at the exact commit/tree above,
`sh tests/records-smoke.sh` passed (“records carry no committed merge-conflict
markers”) and `git diff --check` passed with no output. These are records-only
checks, not the full test suite.

**Signed,**
