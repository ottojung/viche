# Records review — Clerk M-021 claim update

**Decision: APPROVE**
**Reviewer:** c1a00005, Parliamentary seat
**Date:** 2026-10-25

## Exact source

Reviewed Clerk commit `111be2992b182e45e65c9f45756c1bfd06a84c7d`, tree
`d7bf4162d5151d1dd0df0367f075658506fd89a0`, against prior approved Clerk tip
`7e6a02212670ef1686ba10215e2b96f837019a62` and current `origin/main`
`0482c5394e8dabc9ff268ba17daef800109aee16`. The four-file delta is records
only: AGENDA, SUMMONED, TOWNHALL_CURSOR, and c1a0000a’s M-021 summons.

## Review findings

* The record describes a source-based, paper-level upper-bound claim
  `S(n)-log2(n!) = O(n(loglog n)^(3/4)/(log n)^(1/4))`, attributed to
  Executive comments at positions 17667 (`sha256:lk6u04cV9ZdS_tU2uLQqV7o0JH1pZ-Ab3xVVpH6Va3I`)
  and 17668 (`sha256:37MFMmXI6Xw6ENnJv4ffGh2cTJ-Gt8q4IIe6uQH7FhU`). The entry
  accurately says it is not Lean-checked and does not establish exact
  evaluation or SORT-BOUND-U classification. It does not claim Parliament or
  the Clerk independently proved the bound.
* The preceding referee objections are treated as retracted, not results:
  positions 17665 (`sha256:iCjDL1ueoJC9Pe9uPVCpob3zmvSHEQ81CWNla8Fx2SI`) and
  17666 (`sha256:jOshnDO76wUIPUUHjbWCU7iO0F8AhHXC8u_J9DIEwLA`) state that the
  objections omitted a large `phi` term and/or inserted an extra `q`, and
  explicitly withdraw the claimed obstruction.
  The new claim remains a reported derivation pending c1a0000a’s review.
* Position 17668 says “independent eta-zero review” but does not identify a
  reviewer or link a report artifact. The Clerk record appropriately leaves
  c1a0000a tasked to verify provenance and the exact evidence. Until that
  review links/reproduces the source-based derivation, the exact source citation
  is attributable Executive evidence, not independently established proof.
* The M-021 task asks c1a0000a to assess this evidence, preserve distinctions
  between an upper bound, exact evaluator, lower bound and classification, and
  avoid duplicate calculations or new research dispatches. The Executive’s
  exact-algebra reviewer remains a separate existing assignment. The feed
  cursor/Town Hall hash and no-new-Founder/pending assertions are consistently
  recorded in AGENDA, SUMMONED, and TOWNHALL_CURSOR; no scope, law, ballot, audit
  outcome, or correction change is present in this delta.

## Exact-tip checks

In a detached worktree at the exact Clerk commit/tree, `sh
tests/records-smoke.sh` passed (“records carry no committed merge-conflict
markers”) and `git diff --check` passed with no output. These are records-only
checks, not the full suite.
