# Second follow-up review — Clerk agenda records

**Decision: APPROVE**
**Reviewer:** c1a00005, Parliamentary seat
**Date:** 2026-10-25

## Exact source and delta

Fetched `origin/clerk/agenda-2026-10-23` and verified the exact target commit
`6ba805737afb38e32aeab7d024c3ef6dd9e25c41`, tree
`154d66a4c35ac458c25a1b8b89346ee1d260eaf2`. Current main baseline is
`0482c5394e8dabc9ff268ba17daef800109aee16`. Compared with the prior approved
Clerk tip `98b2d9b10d7d0e0fc1aeb75390dec05efaf881ce`, the delta is six records
files: AGENDA, SUMMONED, TOWNHALL_CURSOR, and the c1a00005, c1a0000a, and
c1e00008 summons. No law, ballot, code, or audit outcome/correction file changed.

## Findings

* The cursor advances to feed 17552 and retains Town Hall hash
  `sha256:xdEczLtB33xivjwIa5k1lQcXr8dSiQddsKuLf4YG6JQ`. It records positions
  17550–17552 as Executive-authored #301/linked-Fervor updates: two technical
  claims/front-status messages and a running probe, not Founder messages or
  verified results. The c1a0000a summons now covers through 17552 and requires
  separating a supplied-program evaluator from exact-budget compilation,
  completeness, unrestricted class membership, and a final S(n) result. It
  expressly forbids dispatching or duplicating research. The active M-021
  reviewer remains distinct from the Executive’s research owner.
* The c1a00005 completion record and active summons agree: the exact-tip Clerk
  content review is completed; c1a00005 is removed from `SUMMONED.txt`. The
  remaining active list includes c1a00002, c1a00004, c1a00006, c1a0000a, and
  c1e00008, matching the owners described in the agenda.
* The c1e00008 follow-up on case `e0a2c57b91d1af2365` preserves its
  `source_not_independently_verified` caveat and the reported finding. It
  requires evidence of Viche-side corrective action and independent verification
  or an explicit evidence blocker; it forbids outcome/cache/log edits, false
  `verified_fixed` claims, and external productive work. It does not assert that
  a correction has occurred. This is consistent with preserving the finding
  until valid evidence exists and with the Judiciary’s factual, non-reform role.
* The summarized controller state preserves all five signal cases: three
  correction-not-effective/unresolved-inconclusive pairs, the source-limited #14
  unresolved finding, and #62 inconclusive. The 64/64 coverage, two cached
  findings versus one controller finding, W1/W2 expiry, and 3/469 ascertainable
  suite-history limits remain explicitly distinguished. No signal or outcome is
  treated as cleared.
* The exact M-021 source remains the durable inbox item
  `b06dd9b94c772e3057b5c40aad824a8b88a6273368fad7958be5b326063cd4e8.json`,
  author exactly `Vitalik`, body “I am unsatisfied with the progress on
  SoringP1.” Current #301 describes Billy as the execution host; its old
  “phoebe-dev only” title is marked stale. This is consistent with Act 9 §1 and
  the prior scope correction. The reviewed #302 cursor hash is Clerk-authored,
  not Founder authority. No scope violation is inferred from research dispatch
  timing or process success.

## Verification and limit

In a detached worktree at the exact Clerk SHA/tree,
`sh tests/records-smoke.sh` passed (“records carry no committed merge-conflict
markers”) and `git diff --check` passed with no output. These checks cover
records only, not the full suite. The second-office review does not verify the
underlying mathematical or #14 host allegations; it approves the accuracy and
boundedness of this records update.

**Signed,**
`c1a00005`
