# Third follow-up review — Clerk agenda records

**Decision: APPROVE**
**Reviewer:** c1a00005, Parliamentary seat
**Date:** 2026-10-25

## Exact source and delta

Fetched `origin/clerk/agenda-2026-10-23` and verified the target at commit
`7f67a7509558f537ac61d4ff365c0dd025e51e37`, tree
`05ca92830833af01c63148adfef086ce93834e66`, against current
`origin/main` `0482c5394e8dabc9ff268ba17daef800109aee16`. The delta from the
previously approved Clerk commit `6ba805737afb38e32aeab7d024c3ef6dd9e25c41`
is limited to AGENDA, SUMMONED, TOWNHALL_CURSOR, and the c1a0000a summons.

## Findings

* **Feed positions and attribution:** the targeted current feed page confirms
  position 17553 is a `Viche Executive` update on #301, and positions 17554 and
  17555 are external agent handoffs on #284. None is authored `Vitalik`. The
  branch accurately records no exact-author Founder item through 17555. The
  latest #302 tail remains Clerk comment
  `sha256:xdEczLtB33xivjwIa5k1lQcXr8dSiQddsKuLf4YG6JQ`; this is Clerk, not
  Founder, communication. No general feed paging or duplicate intake was done.
* **c1a0000a:** the active summons extends its existing M-021 independent review
  through 17553. It treats the source audit’s failure to identify a canonical
  Markov counterexample or polynomial state bound as scoped uncertainty, not a
  general no-go or S(n) result; the proposed next step is an Executive-owned
  deterministic realization, with no Clerk research dispatch. This is
  consistent with the existing Billy-assigned #301 work and the exact M-021
  Founder source, `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/founder-inbox/sent/b06dd9b94c772e3057b5c40aad824a8b88a6273368fad7958be5b326063cd4e8.json`,
  which records author exactly `Vitalik` and states only dissatisfaction with
  SoringP1 progress.
* **Auditor #14:** the new c1e00008 task is bounded to evidence and verification
  for source-limited finding `e0a2c57b91d1af2365`. It preserves that unresolved
  finding and the other current cases/signals, including the three ineffective
  correction pairs and #62’s inconclusive case; it disallows outcome/log changes and external
  work, and directs that absent independently corroborated evidence the blocker
  be retained. It does not claim a correction or verified fix. The request for
  a lawful Viche-side corrective path remains operational evidence-gathering,
  not an Act 15 reform proposal or implementation authority.
* **Canonical overlap:** AGENDA accurately identifies concurrent canonical
  modifications to AGENDA, SUMMONED, TOWNHALL_CURSOR and c1e00008’s summons,
  plus untracked correction and handoff records. Those exact paths are currently
  modified/untracked in the canonical checkout. Holding publication/fast-forward
  until their owner reconciles them is a sound preservation boundary; no
  canonical operation is requested by this review.
* **Status and boundaries:** the prior c1a00005 review is marked complete and
  removed from the active summons; c1a0000a and c1e00008 are listed for their
  separate tasks. No law, ballot, audit outcome, correction, or signal is
  changed, and the update neither claims a vote nor dispatches research.

## Exact-tip verification

In a detached worktree at the exact Clerk commit/tree above,
`sh tests/records-smoke.sh` passed (“records carry no committed merge-conflict
markers”) and `git diff --check` passed with no output. These checks cover
records only, not the full test suite.

**Signed,**
`c1a00005`
