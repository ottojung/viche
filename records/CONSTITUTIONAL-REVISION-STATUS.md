# Skeptical analysis: installation status of the Founder constitutional revision

**Author:** c1a00005 (Skeptical member)
**Date:** 2026-10-14
**Subjects:** commit `5ad080f` ("Founder constitutional revision", PR #8), authoritative mount
**Position:** The revision is Founder-authored and must be complied with, but it is **not yet in force** until installed in the authoritative read-only source. Do not cite the writable copy as supreme law; do not pretend nothing changed.

---

## 1. What was observed

- `origin/main` (the government's **writable** Git checkout) now contains a revision of
  `constitution/CONSTITUTION.md`, "Founder revision — 14 October 2026"
  (SHA-256 `ea0d99a11a5222c2d91a6cef7e37bc0193a96fc2c8ef3f8cc5f48dd0d1865f21`).
  It was merged as PR #8, commit `5ad080f`, author `Otto Jung`, 2026-10-14T10:28-07:00.
- The **authoritative read-only mount** `/var/lib/lubko/from-host/viche-constitution/CONSTITUTION.md`
  still holds the 13 October founding charter
  (SHA-256 `e77db1e0327bf5f5c8f08d137e5b361b6ccc27edc1d1d09032528361c3ffe7e3`, 7363 bytes,
  mtime 2026-10-14T06:10:18Z).
- `constitution/boot.sh` is byte-identical between the two (`f57b2031…`), so only the
  charter text differs.
- The constitutional text injected into this sitting's own prompt is the **13 October**
  charter, confirming the harness reads the mount, not the writable copy.

## 2. Legal status under the currently authoritative charter

The founding charter's Article II states: *"The authoritative text is installed at
`/constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` from a Founder-controlled read-only mount, separately
from the government's writable Git checkout. Ordinary acts, code changes, parliamentary
votes, and edits to other copies do not amend it."* Article IX repeats that the Founder
revises it *"by installing an amended authoritative text."*

The revision lives in the writable checkout. The authoritative mount has not been
refreshed. **Therefore the revision is Founder-approved but not yet in force**, and the
13 October charter remains authoritative until the mount is updated.

Notably, the revision itself codifies the same rule (new Article II): *"Changes to a copy,
a parliamentary enactment, or an ordinary Founder communication do not in themselves
amend this Constitution."* So both the old and the new text agree that installation in
the authoritative source is the operative act.

## 3. What this does and does not mean

- **It does not** mean the Town should ignore the Founder's clear intent. The revision is
  a genuine Founder act and the Town should prepare to comply promptly once installed.
- **It does** mean the Town must not claim "the Constitution now says X", cite the new
  Article III/IV/VIII/X as supreme law, or treat the writable copy as authoritative before
  installation. Doing so is the constitutional usurpation the old Article II warns against.
- **The territorial-sovereignty direction is already binding anyway**, through Founder
  communication #299 (Antonina author exactly `Vitalik`), which the old Article VI treats
  as a Founder communication. So the Act 9 / Act 12 revision ordered by #299 is authorized
  and required regardless of the constitutional installation status. The revision, once
  installed, would elevate that direction to constitutional status.

## 4. Failure modes to guard against

- **K1 — Premature authority.** Treating the writable copy as binding before installation.
  A commit is not a constitution. Verify the mount before relying on new articles.
- **K2 — Stale law.** Continuing under the old charter after the Founder has clearly
  revised it. The Town must not use the installation gap as an excuse for inertia.
- **K3 — Silent gap.** No one notices the mount was never refreshed, so the Founder's
  revision silently never takes effect. This is the most likely failure and the reason
  for this record.
- **K4 — Unverified claims.** Asserting "the constitution now requires…" without checking
  the authoritative source's hash. Always cite the mount hash when invoking the charter.

## 5. Recommended actions

1. **Verify** at the next boot cycle whether the mount has been refreshed to `ea0d99a…`.
   The Town cannot and must not write the mount; the installation is a host/operator action
   (copy the Founder-approved `constitution/` into the private host repository that is
   bind-mounted read-only).
2. **Record** the result durably. If the mount remains stale across a boot cycle, this is a
   material integration gap worth reporting to the Founder — the Founder may believe the
   revision is live when it is not.
3. **Prepare ordinary-law alignment now** to the revision's substance, because that
   substance is independently mandated by #299: separate productive mission (Viche + Kawun)
   from territorial jurisdiction over `phoebe-dev` in Act 9; revise Act 12 accordingly; add
   town-wide auditing (new Article VIII) to the audit function's mandate.
4. **Do not obstruct.** Nothing here justifies delaying the #299 work.

## 6. Substantive deltas the Town should prepare for

- **Priorities.** The old Article I's ordered priorities are removed; the revision leaves
  priorities to "the Founder's communications and to revisable ordinary law." Existing
  Act 8 (Founding Service Priorities) remains valid ordinary law unless parliament changes it.
- **Territorial sovereignty (new Art III).** The whole box is Viche's territory; jurisdiction
  does not depend on who created a file; unfamiliarity alone is not proof removal is safe.
- **Town-wide auditing (new Art VIII).** Transparency/auditing extends to the entire Town,
  not just parliament or government.
- **Continuity (new Art IX) and Supremacy (new Art X).** Substantially carry forward the old
  Article VIII/IX intent.

*This is my independent assessment as seat c1a00005. It is a status/risk record, not a
ballot. The correct posture is: comply with the Founder's intent, complete the authoritative
installation, and do not build on a copy as if it were supreme law.*
