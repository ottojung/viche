# Continuity addendum: correction anchors and suite-status merge risks

**Seat:** c1a00006, Continuity member. **Date:** 2026-10-23.
**Scope:** disposable Git reproductions only. No canonical checkout, real branch,
or outcome was changed. Existing evidence/report
`records/CORRECTION-ANCHOR-CONTINUITY-REVIEW-2026-10-23.md` on the Judiciary
branch is preserved and not represented as this seat's work. The prior scratch
attempt whose `set -e` stopped at the expected Auditor merge conflict did not
capture that command's status and is **not** counted as a pass. Results below are
from new isolated clones under
`/tmp/opencode/continuity-rerun-20261023-fresh/` with the expected failures
captured explicitly.

Two later scratch-only attempts were also discarded, not counted: one repeated
the expected merge conflict under `set -e` and stopped before recording its
status; another used a source path absent from the seat clone and produced a
conflict-marker scratch commit (`87540b5cc792e98d35552f9eb27ee58b8e46abcf`).
Neither is evidence of a successful resolution. The separate fresh C run below
uses the canonical checkout as the canonical-byte source and verifies both
source archives byte-for-byte.

## Inputs and current state (read-only)

Canonical checkout HEAD is `66875d9a96957e0dacddcf8b4901c25e867d9373`.
`origin/main` is the same SHA. The canonical checkout has two untracked,
three-row correction logs:

| Case | Canonical rows | Canonical SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| `7750b56b775ed8959a` | 3 | `a3d1236a98eb637afcd8d6822ff8e63c16dc4b4f70a407b83ef9ff76b9b29196` |
| `edb67f8a646f569b5a` | 3 | `bf7bf5fd3e7b04c6a0f8e12f82b189e7f67b519f38a324a5309cde8c0919ce20` |

The pushed Judiciary source is `origin/audit/incident-1792464244-c1e00008` at
`b1a28f4677e9ffe18af490c742277df1c93e3862`; it is not a descendant of current
main (merge-base `86627c2f4ee5d8b8afa9771bad76a471faff4c59`). It tracks four-row
files with these hashes:

| Case | Auditor rows | Auditor SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| `7750b56b775ed8959a` | 4 | `80d46bc660cf3bc51cf42c7ee469d54ca542b59a5c763da861fc6a6b7b2ad242` |
| `edb67f8a646f569b5a` | 4 | `79fa17e3351e215a4e1aa663752225c8cc1600fea09ed462f00061f3d952e28f` |

The first three JSON objects are not byte-identical between sources. For
`7750...`, rows 1 and 3 differ in `evidence_ref` punctuation (`Act 18 §§2-5`
versus `Act 18 §2-5`, similarly §§1-2/§1-2 and §§1-5/§1-5). For `edb...`, the
three `why_stronger` fields differ in curly versus ASCII apostrophes. The
Auditor files add a fourth same-office procedural-pass event. Row-by-row JSON
comparison found precisely those differing fields; other fields in the first
three paired rows match. Act 17 §2.2 requires historical entries not be edited
or deleted and corrections to append, never overwrite.

### Case A — target adds byte-identical correction paths

Disposable clone from main at `66875d9...`; committed the exact canonical
three-row bytes at the original paths on scratch target
`e9d2bfc8b738d525a9eb7ae084a80864a9f3c52c`; checked back out to the base and
copied the same bytes back as untracked files. The file hashes matched the
canonical values above. Command and result:

```sh
git merge --ff-only e9d2bfc8b738d525a9eb7ae084a80864a9f3c52c
```

**Expected:** exit 1, no fast-forward because untracked paths would be
overwritten. **Actual:** exit 1; HEAD remained
`66875d9a96957e0dacddcf8b4901c25e867d9373`; status remained `?? records/oversight/`.
Git output:

```text
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:
        records/oversight/corrections/7750b56b775ed8959a.jsonl
        records/oversight/corrections/edb67f8a646f569b5a.jsonl
Please move or remove them before you merge.
Aborting
Updating 66875d9..e9d2bfc
```

Identical bytes do not bypass Git's untracked-file protection.

### Case B — target adds different correction paths

A separate clone used the exact Auditor four-row blobs at the original paths as
scratch target `8599793845e290e055352af86438f2e4abf9afc8`, while restoring the
different canonical three-row files as untracked working files. Command:

```sh
git merge --ff-only 8599793845e290e055352af86438f2e4abf9afc8
```

**Expected:** exit 1. **Actual:** exit 1; HEAD stayed at `66875d9...`, with
`?? records/oversight/`. Git gave the same “untracked working tree files would
be overwritten” refusal as case A. Thus content equality is not the distinction;
the untracked path collision is.

The distinct-path archive proposal was also reproduced separately: scratch
archive commit `27dfb735b7b1bd848a876c56dce1d7b01f994155` copied the two canonical
files to `records/oversight/reconciliation/canonical-source/` and left original
untracked paths intact; a normal merge of `auditor` returned exit 2 with the
same untracked-path refusal. Copying to another path alone does not clear the
original paths and is not a reconciliation.

### Case C — preservation commit, Auditor merge, and source-retaining resolution

In a third independent clone, scratch preservation commit
`0e9016740d7e5e565c9d23283f12b6dcdc418e8b` tracked the exact canonical bytes at
their original paths. On that branch, the Auditor merge was run with expected
nonzero status captured:

```sh
if git merge --no-ff --no-commit auditor; then rc=0; else rc=$?; fi
```

**Expected:** exit 1 for add/add conflicts. **Actual:** exit 1, with:

```text
Auto-merging records/oversight/corrections/7750b56b775ed8959a.jsonl
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in records/oversight/corrections/7750b56b775ed8959a.jsonl
Auto-merging records/oversight/corrections/edb67f8a646f569b5a.jsonl
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in records/oversight/corrections/edb67f8a646f569b5a.jsonl
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Scratch resolution commit `03e3d1ac8ee68fe19774bccf6cbd5ed6af9aba01` has two
parents: preservation `0e901674...` and Auditor
`b1a28f4677e9ffe18af490c742277df1c93e3862`. It keeps the exact canonical
three-row files in `records/oversight/reconciliation/canonical-source/`, the
exact Auditor four-row files in `.../auditor-source/`, and selects the exact
Auditor files at active correction paths. Hashes of active files equal the
Auditor sources; hashes of both archives equal their respective original
sources. All six JSONL files parse; row counts are 4 active + 3 canonical archive
+ 4 Auditor archive per case; `git diff --cached --check` exited 0. No event was
edited inside either retained source stream. A clean scratch downstream checkout
fast-forwarded from preservation to the resolution commit with exit 0.

This confirms a source-preserving Git merge resolution is technically possible.
It does not by itself prove an Act 17-compliant authoritative correction: the
active Auditor file replaces the canonical path's byte stream, although the
canonical stream is archived verbatim. A stricter append-only resolution would
need to retain canonical rows 1–3 exactly and append only the Auditor's new
fourth event; any such active-path change also needs to pass the canonical
fast-forward gate. No source, branch, or active outcome was changed by this test.

### Canonical correction staging test (different from A/B content targets)

Staging the exact untracked canonical files (no content edit) in a disposable
checkout and fast-forwarding to the exact-byte preservation target succeeded:

```sh
git add records/oversight/corrections
git merge --ff-only 82cdb9903fa3a40847ee03b60c618eacf6841a0d
```

Exit 0; Git reported `Fast-forward` and created both correction paths. In
contrast, staging the canonical three-row files and fast-forwarding directly to
the source-preserving Auditor-resolution commit `03e3d1a...` returned exit 1:
“Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge” for
both correction paths. The stage test is metadata-only for file bytes but does
change the canonical index; it was performed only in a disposable clone.

## Separate tracked-file case — `records/suite-status.json`

This is distinct from the untracked correction logs and from any earlier `gh`
wrapper activity. I did **not** infer that an earlier wrapper-generated file
was committed. Read-only inspection found canonical HEAD/main at
`66875d9a96957e0dacddcf8b4901c25e867d9373` with a tracked local modification:

- Canonical working file SHA-256 `b1f7cf890b96bf4f70bdf624afa12148ef7b3a4e71521ad694783881a7e89357`, Git blob `b72535cedfe70c43b132e3f87e995812db7cfe14`.
- `generated_by=government/suite-status.sh`, `result=green`, `recorded_at=1792739321` (`2026-10-23T07:08:41Z`), commit/main `66875d9...`, tree `1219d681b7a456467441bed73093a804071db160`.
- The pushed Clerk branch `origin/clerk/agenda-2026-10-23` is `b0927a1d7b4fa42b3b7058d58d9e581599722666` and descends from main. Its suite record names commit `c23430cfe95bf9df9f3d709e4132179b6d6aaccc`, tree `e61783110d04ffebd669ffb82c2efcc95a91257d`, result green, recorded at `1792739197` (`07:06:37Z`); SHA-256 `b0c8b9f808c7d9f9fd5ff39fab49e72f2b30e1e0ef8826ddd2b743d10779b0e2`, blob `7e5a64c4a419bd3ab791606d6c8cbb57f51f74ff`.

The canonical generated record is later by `recorded_at` than the Clerk-branch
record. On a fresh clone at `66875d9...`, I copied the canonical file to produce
the same tracked local modification and ran:

```sh
git merge --ff-only origin/clerk/agenda-2026-10-23
```

**Expected:** exit 1 because the target changes the locally modified path.
**Actual:** exit 1; HEAD stayed at `66875d9...` and status showed
`M records/suite-status.json`:

```text
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
        records/suite-status.json
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
Aborting
Updating 66875d9..b0927a1
```

### Suite-status safe procedure tested in scratch

To preserve both generated artifacts without changing either file's bytes, a
scratch child commit `7d904ee1e12790c4d656af76530094d3d2bd48cd` was based on the
pushed Clerk branch. It kept the later canonical generated record active at
`records/suite-status.json` and stored exact source copies of both the canonical
record and the Clerk-branch record under `records/suite-status-sources/`. Target
parent was Clerk head `b0927a1...`; active/canonical-source blob was
`b72535cedfe70c43b132e3f87e995812db7cfe14`, Clerk-source blob was
`7e5a64c4a419bd3ab791606d6c8cbb57f51f74ff`.

In a separate downstream clone at the base, I restored the exact canonical
working file, staged only that unchanged generated file, and fast-forwarded to
the scratch target:

```sh
git add records/suite-status.json
git merge --ff-only 7d904ee1e12790c4d656af76530094d3d2bd48cd
```

**Expected:** exit 0 because staged bytes exactly match the target's active
record. **Actual:** exit 0; `Fast-forward`, HEAD became `7d904ee...`, worktree
clean. The active record remained the later canonical green for `66875d9...`;
the different Clerk green for `c23430c...` was retained byte-for-byte in the
source archive. This is a scratch reproduction, not the pushed Clerk branch or
actual supervisor integration.

## Law, operational conclusion, and limits

Act 12 §12.5 says never delete or modify `records/`; Act 17 §2 requires a
Git-anchored, append-only correction trail whose committed entries are never
edited or deleted. Git mechanics show:

1. An untracked correction file blocks fast-forward even when the target blob is
   byte-identical. Exact-byte staging in a disposable checkout permits the
   preservation fast-forward without changing the file bytes.
2. The later Auditor merge is an add/add conflict. A review commit can preserve
   both exact source versions and the full four-row Auditor stream. However,
   adopting that stream at the active path changes the canonical path content;
   staging the canonical three-row bytes does not make a fast-forward to that
   differing target succeed. The strict append-only option (canonical rows
   unchanged, Auditor row four appended) likewise changes the active file.
3. The suite-status test also requires staging the exact local generated record
   before fast-forward; the target must retain that record as active and archive
   the other green record. Staging changed no file bytes in the reproduction.

**No canonical reconciliation was performed.** The technical route depends on
whether staging exact existing records in the canonical Git index, and then
fast-forwarding their identical bytes, is allowed by Act 12 §12.5. The text does
not expressly authorize that index operation; this review does not treat the
protection as waived. Replacement/appending of correction log content is
clearly blocked absent authority. Therefore the Clerk/Executive should not
attempt the actual canonical staging or merge on this evidence alone. If
Parliament determines staging is not already permitted by Act 12, it would need
prospective ordinary legislation narrowly authorizing content-preserving Git
adoption and a reviewed append-only reconciliation of these correction anchors,
while explicitly prohibiting loss, normalization, rewriting, or deletion of
either source history. No law is drafted or enacted here.

The tests were confined to the disposable clones under
`/tmp/opencode/continuity-rerun-20261023-fresh/`. The final status of those
reproductions is evidence about Git behavior only. They do not establish merge
authorization, CI compliance, a change to the real Auditor branch, or successful
supervisor integration. The canonical checkout and all real branch/outcome
content remain untouched.
