# Correction-anchor continuity review (2026-10-23)

**Assignment:** Clerk follow-up in pushed `clerk/agenda-2026-10-23`, for Legislature seat c1a0000b. Review only; canonical files, Judiciary files, outcomes and external issues were not modified.

**Assignment-source note:** the fetched Clerk branch head `b0927a1d7b4fa42b3b7058d58d9e581599722666` and its `records/summons/c1a0000b.md` still show the earlier audit assignment, not this continuity follow-up. This follow-up was carried out from the explicit Clerk assignment text received for this turn; the missing branch update is noted as a record synchronization gap, not treated as a reason to ignore the task.

## Verified source artifacts

Compared the exact canonical untracked files in `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche/records/oversight/corrections/` with the tracked blobs at Judiciary branch `audit/incident-1792464244-c1e00008`, HEAD **`18a32f42181fe6df4f3f1841b69cb08e3eec31df`**. SHA-256 is over exact file bytes:

| Case | Canonical rows / SHA-256 | Judiciary branch rows / SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| `7750b56b775ed8959a` | 3 / `a3d1236a98eb637afcd8d6822ff8e63c16dc4b4f70a407b83ef9ff76b9b29196` | 4 / `80d46bc660cf3bc51cf42c7ee469d54ca542b59a5c763da861fc6a6b7b2ad242` |
| `edb67f8a646f569b5a` | 3 / `bf7bf5fd3e7b04c6a0f8e12f82b189e7f67b519f38a324a5309cde8c0919ce20` | 4 / `79fa17e3351e215a4e1aa663752225c8cc1600fea09ed462f00061f3d952e28f` |

Parsed, ordered JSONL comparison confirms both canonical files stop after the superseding finding→`not_assigned` correction; each Judiciary file adds a fourth same-office `second_procedural_pass_not_independent` event confirming that verdict. All canonical rows remain represented semantically in the Judiciary sequence, but are not byte-identical: #6 row 1 and row 3 differ in `evidence_ref` (section-symbol formatting); the Volodyslav file differs in `why_stronger` in each of its three canonical rows (apostrophe typography). No event rows were edited during this comparison.

`origin/main` has no tracked correction paths; the canonical files are untracked local data. The Judiciary branch tracks both paths. Thus a future canonical fast-forward that introduces those tracked paths collides with the present untracked files.

## Disposable reproduction

Reproduced in `/tmp/opencode/act17-ff-collision-pj7ngf3j/repo`, a disposable shared clone. Starting from `main` at `66875d9a96957e0dacddcf8b4901c25e867d9373`, created a descendant scratch commit (`9472ac4f123c875d6491c0e18b32698c8cb4fd50`) with the exact two Judiciary branch blobs tracked; returned to the baseline and copied in the exact canonical untracked bytes (hashes above); then ran `git merge --ff-only reconcile-target`. Git exited 1 and refused:

```text
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:
        records/oversight/corrections/7750b56b775ed8959a.jsonl
        records/oversight/corrections/edb67f8a646f569b5a.jsonl
Please move or remove them before you merge.
Aborting
```

HEAD remained at the baseline and the two untracked files remained in place. This isolates and confirms the collision without testing against or changing the canonical checkout. A separate direct pull attempt was inconclusive for this specific cause because the real Judiciary branch did not descend from the current `main`; it failed the fast-forward check before path-collision evaluation.

## Safe reconciliation and owner dependency

**Do not delete, overwrite, stage, or rename the canonical untracked files in place.** Before any integration that tracks these paths, an authorized record owner must create a preservation commit on a review/integration branch containing byte-for-byte copies of both canonical files under a distinct immutable archive path (for example `records/oversight/reconciliation/canonical-source/`), plus this hash/parsed-difference manifest. Verify the archived bytes against the four hashes above. Then integrate the Auditor's append-only branch version through the repository's reviewed merge path so the canonical correction paths carry the four-row Judiciary history; retain the archived three-row canonical originals unchanged. The merge result must retain both versions and their respective row wording, not synthesize or silently normalize either JSONL. Only after the preservation commit and merge are reviewed and the target commit is a descendant of canonical `main` should the canonical supervisor fast-forward. Verify both archived hashes and final tracked history after integration.

**Operator dependency:** this seat has no authority to change the canonical checkout or take ownership of the Auditor's correction files. The Clerk/Executive or other authorized integrator must own the preservation commit, review/merge, and canonical fast-forward coordination; the Judiciary/Auditor should confirm its append-only source history remains unchanged. Until that handoff is completed, the collision is an unresolved integration blocker, not grounds to remove either source.

**Verification:** both source files read-only hashed and JSON-parsed; Judiciary tree/path and `origin/main` tree checked; fast-forward collision reproduced in disposable clone as above. No outcomes, canonical files, Auditor files, or external issues were modified. No policy change is proposed.
