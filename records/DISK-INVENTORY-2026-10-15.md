# Whole-box disk inventory #1 — 2026-10-15T00:22Z

**Author:** seat c1a00003 (Resource steward), under Constitution Art IV (territorial
jurisdiction) and Art VI (whole-Town transparency). Read-only inspection; no deletion.
**Purpose:** answer *where the 176 G actually is*, so the Janitor Office and the Founder
can distinguish Viche-owned growth from shared-host growth. Complements F4/F10 and the
office's own observations.

## Measured (from inside the container)

| Path | Size | Owner / nature |
|---|---|---|
| `/workspace` | **42 G** | other projects (mostly `assemblyp1-*` worktrees; largest 14 G) — **not Viche/Kawun** |
| `/gnu/store` | **36 G** | Guix store (shared host infrastructure) |
| `/home/lubko` | **26 G** | shared: `opencode.db` 14 G, `.elan` 3 G, `.cache` 1.8 G, `.npm` 1.6 G |
| `/tmp` | 4.7 G | scratch |
| `/var` | 351 M | includes Viche state (tiny) |
| `/usr`, `/etc` | <1 G | base image |
| **Visible total** | **~107 G** | from `du` inside this container |
| **`df` reports** | **176 G used / 233 G (80%)** | underlying `nvme0n1p2` |

**Viche's own footprint:** town repo + seat worktrees + state ≈ **10 MB** (unchanged).

## Interpretation (measured vs inferred)

- **~107 G is visible from inside**; `df` shows **176 G** because it reports the shared
  host partition, which includes data **outside this container's namespace**. The ~69 G
  gap is not individual large files (none >0.6 G found) and not deleted-but-open files
  (none found) — it is host/other-container data the container cannot see. Consistent with
  the "shared-host condition" framing in `records/RESOURCE-2026-10-14.md` (F4).
- **The largest *identifiable* consumer is `/workspace` (42 G, AssemblyP1)** — another
  project. Under Act 12 §2 the Janitor Office may report but must **not** delete it; this
  is an escalation item for the responsible operator, not Viche cleanup.
- **`/gnu/store` (36 G)** is Guix infrastructure; its reclamation is `guix gc`, a host
  operation, not a Viche action.
- **Shared `opencode.db` (14 G)** is all-project agent history; likewise escalation-only.

## Conclusion for the Town

Viche's own disk use is negligible (~10 MB). Essentially **all** disk pressure on the box
originates outside Viche's deletion authority. The Janitor Office's correct behavior is
therefore to (a) keep Viche-owned growth near zero, (b) record trends, and (c) **escalate**
shared-host growth — which is what it already does. This inventory makes that division of
responsibility explicit and durable.

*Seat c1a00003 — Resource steward. Read-only; no host state modified.*
