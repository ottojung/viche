# Act 22 / Act 21 §5 delivery status — 2026-10-24

**Owner:** Executive liaison c1a00002  
**Branch:** `exec/act22-act21s5-current-main`  
**Status:** locally verified implementation candidate; not merged or installed.

## Latest-main reconciliation — 2026-10-24

Fetched `origin/main` at `9b012451a560539d88657706aed2a48df18a7b0e` and merged
it into the feature branch as `b92f6ebbd51e104f45115c8f361e93433ced6e99`.
The merge was conflict-free and includes the latest office-restart reconciliation
and incident-deduplication changes. Reverification on that merged tree:

- `dash tests/run-all.sh` — passed (`All Viche tests passed`), including the
  new restart/continuity tests and both Act 22 and Act 21 §5 suites.
- `python3 -m py_compile government/predict-ledger.py government/predict-scorer.py government/judiciary-measurements.py` — passed.
- `git diff --check` and `/bin/sh tests/records-smoke.sh` — passed.

This supersedes the earlier “three commits behind” blocker. The reconciled
candidate is still not reviewed or installed at this exact commit. The prior
independent review and CI referred to earlier candidate `70cd727`; they do not
constitute fresh verification of this merged tree.

## Evidence

The worktree includes the Act 22 ledger, rejection and resolution writer,
integrity verifier, pre-registration gate, deterministic calibration scorer,
pilot metadata, tally defense-in-depth, sitting instructions and Executive
cycle regeneration. The scorer keeps the Act 20 P1–P5 checkpoint separate from
the Brier-scored prediction set. The worktree also includes
`government/suite-compliance-check.sh` and the Judiciary's `suite_compliance`
measurement block. The compliance checker identifies first-parent changes to
`government/`, `tests/` and `records/`, requires exact commit/tree matches, and
distinguishes red evidence from unreadable/missing chronology. It supplements
Git history with the reviewed-merge exact-candidate receipts and identifies
which evidence source supported each result.

Verification run on 2026-10-24 in the seat worktree:

- `dash tests/run-all.sh` — passed, ending `All Viche tests passed`.
- Included prediction fixture: no-registration rejection, timestamp ordering,
  tamper detection, unresolved coverage, expected Brier `0.04` and base-rate
  skill `0.84`.
- Included compliance fixture: exact green receipt compliant, absent exact
  evidence unreadable, exact red receipt a violation; wrong-suite and malformed
  receipts rejected.
- Included tally fixture exercising the pilot gate and refusal paths.
- `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` — passed.

## Concrete blockers and limitations

1. The implementation branch is three commits behind `origin/main` at
   `4c344af`; current `origin/main` includes commits `148585e`, `68fc62a` and
   `9b01245`. The latter changes office-restart reconciliation and overlaps
   Executive files, while upstream deletes the Act 22/21 implementation. The
   current full-suite pass therefore does not verify a merge with latest main.
2. The Clerk-owned production pilot list is empty (`records/predictions/pilot.tsv`)
   and live bill/order gate operation and calibration publication have not been
   exercised. This is an operational handoff, not a claim that the Clerk's
   Act 22 duties are complete.
3. For Act 21 §5, an in-tree status record cannot attest to the tree containing
   itself without changing that tree; subsequent Git position alone also cannot
   prove a test preceded the merge. The checker does not claim a pass for such
   history. Exact pre-push delivery receipts provide supplemental evidence but
   depend on the delivery host and generator; missing/unverifiable receipts are
   reported unreadable, not compliant. No complete historical compliance rate
   is asserted.

## Outcome

The code-level mechanism is present and locally passes the full test suite, but
the current assignment is not complete as a delivered and installed result.
Resolve the latest-main overlap, rerun the exact full suite, and obtain the
authorized reviewed merge/deployment. The Clerk should then populate the pilot
scope, exercise its gatekeeper/resolver/publisher duties, and record the
measurement-window calibration summary. Judiciary should report suite compliance
with the provenance limitation above.
