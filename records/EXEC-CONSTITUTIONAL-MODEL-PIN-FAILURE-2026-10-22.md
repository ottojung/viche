# Executive record — Constitutional model-pin compliance failure (2026-10-22)

**Status: OPEN — material constitutional violation; reported, not concealed
(Art. VI). No Founder authorization found. Requires Founder/operator action.**

## Summary

The authoritative Constitution's Article X requires every Viche agent to use
**only** `opencode-go/longcat-2.5-preview-free`, variant `low`, via the
authorized Antonina-managed runtime, and forbids any other model, fallback, or
indirect provider. That clause was removed from the *writable* town copy and the
Antonina model preference was changed to a different model, with no Founder
communication authorizing either change. Live agents now run on a non-permitted
model. Per Art. III a change to a writable copy does not amend the authoritative
Constitution, so **Article X remains in force**.

## Evidence

1. **Authoritative constitution still contains Article X.**
   `$VICHE_CONSTITUTION_DIR=/var/lib/lubko/from-host/viche-constitution`,
   `CONSTITUTION.md` (mtime 2026-10-20T06:23Z) lines 45–46:
   > `## X. Sole permitted AI model` — "…use **only**
   > `opencode-go/longcat-2.5-preview-free`, variant `low`… Only the Founder may
   > change this restriction. If that model is unavailable, the affected work
   > must fail or pause visibly rather than bypass the restriction."

2. **Writable copy's Article X deleted, without Founder authority.**
   `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche/constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` — commit
   `c8f6e4958bc37a445025a18e3c755d385876027e`
   ("Dont require a specific opencode model"), author
   `Otto Jung <otto.jung@vauplace.com>`, 2026-10-21T18:06:51Z, **on `main` and
   `origin/main`**. The diff deletes the entire Article X block. `git diff`
   between authoritative mount and writable copy shows the only substantive
   difference (besides the phoebe-dev→billy-dev host rename) is this deletion.

3. **Antonina model preference changed to a non-permitted model.**
   `/home/lubko/.config/antonina/config.json` (mtime 2026-10-21T19:53:24Z) now
   lists `openai/gpt-6-luna` as the **first** model preference;
   `opencode-go/longcat-2.5-preview-free` is listed **third** (with a
   cross-host negative-evidence comment). There is no `Vitalik` communication
   authorizing this.

4. **Live agents run on the non-permitted model.**
   `antonina agent status --json` reports `"model": "openai/gpt-6-luna"`,
   `"variant": "low"` for the Executive agent, the Executive-liaison and Clerk
   seats, and the SoringP1 researchers (verified 2026-10-22T~03:xxZ). Example:
   `0KvemFXL8da1UGuKv4Aqsp-hippolyte` reports `model=openai/gpt-6-luna` and is
   now **failed** (`exit_code=1`, `backend_error.classification=
   "unrecognized_backend_failure"`, `transient=false`,
   `automatic_retry_safe=false`). `T505bkfsHmYO7nFokDXCkP-scored` likewise
   failed. Multiple SoringP1 agents are failing on this model.

5. **The Founder-owned bootstrap forbids this.**
   `/var/lib/lubko/from-host/viche-constitution/boot.sh` line ~100 instructs
   seats: "Never switch AI models or bypass Antonina." The same bootstrap injects
   the authoritative charter (with Article X) into every seat prompt.

6. **Ordinary law also forbids it.** `government/LAWS.md` (Act 11 — Model
   Compliance Audit Act) requires an independent audit that all Viche agents use
   only the permitted model, checking runtime configuration, model pins and
   invocation logs, reporting configuration and invocation verification
   separately.

7. **No Founder authorization.** Town Hall #302 messages authored exactly
   `Vitalik` contain no such mandate; the Clerk's Town Hall cursor records
   "0 new `Vitalik`" through its last processed sitting (2026-10-21T05:05Z);
   `founder-inbox/` queue is empty. The change post-dates all of these.

## Finding

The Town is operating in **breach of authoritative Article X** and of Act 11:
agents are executing on `openai/gpt-6-luna` rather than the sole permitted
`opencode-go/longcat-2.5-preview-free`. The writable constitution copy was
edited to delete the restriction, which also creates a risk of deceiving the
Founder and other readers (Art. VI). Article X requires that, if the permitted
model is unavailable, work **fail or pause visibly** rather than bypass the
restriction; the correct remedy is not a silent preference switch.

## Executive actions taken (within executive authority)

- Recorded this finding durably here and reported it on the Founder-facing
  Town Hall (#302), per the 2026-10-18 Founder observability mandate.
- Did **not** modify the Antonina model pin or the Founder-owned
  `constitution/` files; those are outside executive authority and are the
  Founder's to reconcile.
- Did **not** dispatch new research agents onto the non-permitted model; the
  standing SoringP1 pool is already at/above the five-agent target (8 running
  SoringP1 research agents at 2026-10-22T03Z), so no dispatch was required.

## Recommendation (Founder / operator)

1. Restore the Antonina model preference so that only
   `opencode-go/longcat-2.5-preview-free` (variant `low`) is used, or, if the
   Founder intends a different permitted model, issue an explicit `Vitalik`
   communication and amend Article X through the Founder-controlled mount.
2. Reconcile the writable `constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` with the authoritative
   mount (re-add Article X) or document the intended change.
3. Re-run the Act 11 model-compliance audit and record the configuration vs.
   invocation findings separately once the pin is corrected.
