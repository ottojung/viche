# M-022 recovery service deployment verification

**Owner:** Executive liaison `c1a00002`  
**Date:** 2026-10-27  
**Result:** one controlled S6 restart completed; service is up under the merged startup ordering and the pre-existing recovery-agent appointment was preserved without another dispatch.

## Merged target

- Canonical `main` / `origin/main`: `58af28f5a86b3734d5e5fba6e25922d401dde52d`
- Tree: `7c013a8749543f0c9453a63f9b7bf58f1f850420`
- The merge integrates `5c778290b07a6bffab3f9c5cdb20dbd965c11bcd` (`Fix recovery steward profile startup ordering`).
- Exact Act 21 receipt: `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/delivery/verified-58af28f5a86b3734d5e5fba6e25922d401dde52d.json`; `tests/run-all.sh`, result `green`, recorded at `1793093246`.
- Canonical `government/recovery-steward-service.sh` SHA-256 at verification: `8d28c6fb523ac368cbf087ac3169bc3f3524f9a6453ccd9842ddbd35542cdd2c`. `git diff --quiet HEAD -- government/recovery-steward-service.sh deploy/s6/viche-recovery/run` returned 0; S6's launched shell command targets this canonical service script.

## Before and after

| Evidence | Before restart | After restart |
|---|---|---|
| Time (UTC) | 2026-10-27 13:09:08Z | 2026-10-27 13:10:32Z |
| `s6-svstat` | `up=true`, `wantedup=true`, PID/PGID `1239`, uptime 22503 s | `up=true`, `wantedup=true`, PID/PGID `13496`, uptime 28 s |
| Supervisor child | `/bin/sh /var/lib/lubko/wd/viche/government/recovery-steward-service.sh`, PID 1239, started 06:54:27Z | same canonical command, PID 13496, started 13:10:03Z |
| Recovery agent | `CnLRMtqxqFE6w01U7WmuZT-greedily`, state `running`, session `ses_e83e11053ffe2ebQ0bGCowmzQj`, pending steers 0 | same ID/session, state `running`, pending steers 0 |
| Appointment registry | one `recovery-steward` row for `CnLRMtqxqFE6w01U7WmuZT-greedily` | same single row |
| Recovery dispatch ledger | 13 rows; latest `2026-10-27T09:15:41Z`, same ID | still 13 rows; latest row unchanged; dispatch log mtime unchanged |

The running-agent inventory had no unreadable rows and exactly one recovery-steward match before and after. Thus the restart loaded the deployed target without creating or dispatching a duplicate appointment. The existing agent remained active; this check does not assert completion of its recovery investigation.

## Operational caveat

The S6 `ready` field was `false` both before and after. The persistent service does not implement a readiness notification; `s6-svstat` nevertheless reported it `up` and `wantedup`. The host wrapper also emitted `date: not found` for its debug timestamp, and startup logged `UDEV_HWDB_PATH: parameter not set` while sourcing the Guix profile. Neither diagnostic caused the new run to exit: PID 13496 remained up for 28 seconds, the existing agent remained running, and appointment/dispatch state remained unchanged. These diagnostics are retained as observed and are not represented as a clean readiness signal.

## Action record

Immediately before the one authorized restart, `/bin/sh` and S6 status, Antonina agent status/list, the appointment registry, and `recovery-steward/dispatches.tsv` were inspected. Ran exactly once:

```sh
s6-svc -r /run/service/viche-recovery
```

Afterward, rechecked `s6-svstat`, process command/PID/start time, Antonina status and running inventory, appointment row, dispatch ledger/log, canonical `main` SHA/tree, target file hash and supervisor log. No retry was issued. No service code, appointment registry, Clerk worktree, or Judiciary worktree was modified.
