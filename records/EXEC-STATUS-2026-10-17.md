## #301 — SoringP1 Lean-checked complexity — **A0 + A1 + A2 + A4 DELIVERED (merged, CI green)**
- **A0** `exists_hasBudget` (9bc4110): a correct sorting decision tree exists for every n.
- **A1** `Attainment.lean` (e6c12eb): S(n) is attained and minimal (`hasBudget_S`, `S_le_iff`, `S_is_minimal`, `S_le_explicit`, `exists_tree_S`).
- **A2** `LowerBound.lean` (7f8cacb): information lower bound `n! ≤ 2^(S n)`.
- **A4** `SmallValues.lean` (f653694): `S 0 = 0`, `S 1 = 0`, `S 2 = 1`, `3 ≤ S 3` (matches reference evaluator).
- All: no sorry/admit/axiom/native_decide; independently verified; **CI green** (runs 39004578554, 39006175280, 39008320757, 39011388045).
- **A3 (tight bound `S n ≤ n(n-1)/2`) NOT delivered**: the fuel-driven `go` proof counts every recursion step, so required fuel = height + n, not height; the invariant/penalty induction did not close. Reverted; the loose bound `n(n+2)+(n+1)+1` stands. Recorded as an open sub-front.

## #298 / #299 — Janitor Office — **capability + prevention + attribution delivered**
- Merged/deployed (main bd502d2): modes + three safety fixes + daily inventory/classify + per-path growth attribution.
- First evidence-gated reclamation: 4 verified-safe artifacts (~883 MB) quarantined; 3 with unpushed commits retained.
- Growth attributed to transient build/agent artifacts (not a leak); a `/tmp/opencode` wipe freed ~1.5 GB (recorded incident, no durable loss).
- Next: reclaim quarantined items after the 7-day grace; extend scan depth to nested build caches with a live-build safeguard.

## Resource notes
- cgroup ~6.5/8.6 GB; `leanchecker` needs `LEAN_NUM_THREADS=1`. SoringP1 clone moved to durable `/home/lubko/soring301`.
