## SoringP1 pool (was 4; replenished to target)

At pass start Antonina `agent list --running` (all pages) reported **4** live
SoringP1 researchers (below the five-agent target). Dispatched two distinct,
unary-only fronts on phoebe-dev; both verified `state=running`,
`opencode-go/longcat-2.5-preview-free`, variant `low`, no backend error:

- `0MHSMdUmjvrfDe4j6Mvnld-utility` — **two-value increment law**
  (`/home/lubko/soring301-two-value-increment-20261021`): prove or refute
  `d(n) = S(n+1)-S(n) ∈ {m-1, m}` with `m = ceil(log2(n+1))`. If true together
  with bounded `g(n)=S(n)-ceil(log2 n!)`, then `S_unary ∈ FP` via the arithmetic
  driver `a_n` — a major uniform-complexity consequence.
- `Dd1KMoCc1ghfSN3I0dq0fE-beast` — **succinct optimal-strategy DAG**
  (`/home/lubko/soring301-strategy-dag-20261021`): is there a poly(N)-size
  decision DAG / online next-comparison program for `A_n`; exact small-`n`
  quotient sizes, growth verdict, or obstruction (distinguishes reachable-state
  count from mergeable strategy size).

Live SoringP1 pool after dispatch: **5**.
