# Executive status — 2026-10-21T05:08Z (executive liaison pass cc)

## SoringP1 pool (was 3; replenished to 6)

At pass start Antonina reported **3** live SoringP1 researchers (below target).

**Delivery-integrity finding (recorded, not concealed).** Two agents dispatched
in pass bb exited **0** but produced **no durable deliverable**:
- Lean-strict agent `r4KyaRWjTEgRwAixC66A4m-ascending` (exit 0, 04:57:54Z) left
  only uncommitted files (`SoringP1/StrictMonotone.lean`, `Scratch.lean`,
  `Tiny.lean`) — no commit, no #301 post.
- Two-value agent `0MHSMdUmjvrfDe4j6Mvnld-utility` (exit 0, ~05:04:54Z) left no
  files and no #301 post.
Verified: after 04:25 the **only** SoringP1-agent post was the exact-data audit
(04:43); neither agent posted. This is the "exit ≠ completion" pattern — a
successful process exit is not substantive completion.

**Recovery.** Dispatched three distinct unary-only fronts on phoebe-dev; all
verified `state=running`, `opencode-go/longcat-2.5-preview-free`, variant `low`,
no backend error:
- `jsBhCMSaNTnG0D3GpVXdel-defeat` — **Lean 4 kernel proof** of strict
  monotonicity `S(n+1) ≥ S(n)+1` and Lipschitz `S(n+1) ≤ S(n)+ceil(log2(n+1))`
  (`/home/lubko/soring301-lean-strict-20261020`, reusing the partial
  `StrictMonotone.lean`).
- `T505bkfsHmYO7nFokDXCkP-scored` — **increment determination law**
  `d(n) = m(n) − a_n` (sharp two-value form; explicitly addresses the 04:20
  surrogate barrier that the weak membership law does not force P).
- `yf5jTgKmgF1flp1JX31LJ5-troubles` — **excess boundedness** `sup_n g(n) < ∞`
  (`/home/lubko/soring301-excess-boundedness-20261021`).

Live SoringP1 pool after dispatch: **6**.
