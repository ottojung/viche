# System-wide disk inventory — phoebe-dev (2026-10-14)

**Author:** c1a00005 (Skeptical member, Phoebe seat)
**Method:** read-only. `df`, `df -i`, `findmnt`, `du -sh`/`du -sh -d1` (bounded by `timeout`). No mutation.
**Purpose:** first genuine system-wide inventory for Founder directive #299; input to the Janitor Office.

## 1. Filesystem

- Device `/dev/nvme0n1p2` (ext4), mounted at `/`, `/workspace`, `/gnu`, `/tmp`, `/home/lubko`, `/var/lib/lubko/wd`, `/var/lib/lubko/from-host`.
- **232.7 GiB total, 173.5 GiB used, ~48 GiB free — 79% used.**
- Inodes: 15,564,800 total, 4,780,439 used (31%).
- Cgroup memory: ~4.1 GiB of 8 GiB (48%). Level `ok` (janitor observation 18:10Z).

## 2. Mounted host paths visible inside the container

`findmnt` shows the container bind-mounts these host locations:

| Container path | Host source (under `/home/user1/…`) | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `/workspace` | `.local/share/phoebe-dev/workspace` | **42 G** |
| `/gnu/store` | `/gnu/store` (Guix) | **36 G** |
| `/home/lubko` | `.local/share/phoebe-dev/home` | **25 G** |
| `/var/guix` | `/var/guix` | 203 M |
| `/var/lib/lubko/wd` | `.local/share/phoebe-dev/wd` | 147 M |
| `/var/lib/lubko/from-host` | `my/media/text/config-private/other/lubko-fs/from-host` | 80 K |

**Viche's own footprint** under `/var/lib/lubko/wd`: `viche` 4.9 M + `viche-seats` 4.7 M + `viche-state` 76 K ≈ **10 M**. Viche is a negligible consumer.

## 3. Largest single consumers

- `/workspace/assemblyp1-94b15` — **13 G**.
- `/workspace` — **42 G across 426 entries**, overwhelmingly per-task experiment/build directories named `assemblyp1-*`, `lubko-*`, `antonina-*`, e.g.:
  - `assemblyp1` 581 M; `assemblyp1-research-story-20261013` 578 M; `assemblyp1-programmers-rethink-20261013` 578 M; `assemblyp1-programmers-ml-20261013` 578 M; `assemblyp1-context-20261013` 578 M; `assemblyp1-94-phoebe-cle-kernel2` 494 M; `assemblyp1-repeat-71` 492 M; `assemblyp1-population-0922` 482 M; `assemblyp1-pr79` 476 M; `assemblyp1-rigidity-0922` 475 M; many more at ~150–450 M.
  - `lubko-issue-737-budget-digest` 412 M; `lubko-issue-751` 371 M; `lubko-issue-773` 194 M; `antonina-issue-18-init` 176 M; `antonina-issue-16-web` 176 M.
- `/gnu/store` — **36 G** (Guix system store; system packages).
- `/home/lubko` — **25 G** (dominated by `node-install` 168 M, `opencode-node` 116 M, and dozens of ~23 M `debug*`/`verify*`/`acceptance*`/`absent*` scratch dirs).

## 4. Interpretation (distinct from measurements)

1. **The container cannot see all of the 173.5 G.** Visible mounted paths total ~103 G; the remaining ~70 G is on the shared ext4 filesystem outside the container's bind mounts. A container-run Janitor Office can inventory and act only on **mounted** paths. System-wide authority is therefore bounded by mount visibility — a fact the office and any Act 12 design must state.
2. **`/workspace` is the richest reclamation candidate.** 426 entries, many apparently per-task experiment outputs (`assemblyp1-*`, `lubko-*`, `antonina-*`) with similar names and sizes — the "abandoned / duplicate artifacts" the Founder described. They are **not Viche/Kawun**, so under #299 they are unexplained occupants subject to investigation, **not** automatic protection.
3. **Caution is mandatory.** Some entries may be active work of another project. Under the J1–J8 review, none may be removed without the evidence standard (what/why/recoverable/liveness/ownership check) and quarantine for uncertainty. `phone-home` 518 M, `fakehome` 218 M, `rankproj` 280 M also need classification.
4. **`/gnu/store` (36 G) is not janitorial clutter** — it is the Guix system store; removing it would break the box. Classify as retain.
5. **Viche's own footprint (~10 M) is not the problem.** The disk pressure is shared-project artifact accumulation, not Viche growth.

## 5. Recommended next steps (evidence-based)

1. For the top `/workspace` candidates, determine **liveness and ownership**: is the directory referenced by any live process, git ref, board issue, or recent mtime? Record per J1–J8.
2. Classify each as retain/monitor, reclaim-when-verified-safe, quarantine-before-removal, or escalate (bill §12.3).
3. Do **not** delete anything yet: `reclaim_enabled=0`, no Act 12 yet, and the evidence standard is not met.
4. Feed this inventory into the Janitor Office's metrics so growth is tracked over time.
