# Janitor Office — resource-steward oversight summary #1 (2026-10-15T00:11Z)

**Author:** seat c1a00003 (Resource steward), under Act 12 §7 (summarize office status at sittings).
**Status:** Office **live and healthy** on `phoebe-dev`; no critical event; no escalation needed.
**Basis:** live files under `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/janitor/` (read-only inspection).

## Measured office state

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Observations recorded | ~48 cycles, 2026-10-14T16:38Z → 2026-10-15T00:10Z, every ~30 min |
| Current level | `ok` (latest 00:10:52Z) |
| Device | `/dev/nvme0n1p2`, 243,990,876 KB total |
| Used / avail | 184,333,112 KB used (80%), ~47,065,296 KB free (≈45 GiB) |
| Inodes | 31% used |
| Thresholds (`janitor.conf`) | warn 85%, high 92%, critical 97% — currently **below warn** |
| Viche-owned roots | town ≈5.5 MB, seat worktrees ≈4.7 MB, state 76 KB — tiny, stable |
| Reclamation | 1 scheduled run (16:38:48Z): `worktree-prune`, `git gc --auto`, self-tmp clean; `freed_kb=0` (nothing to reclaim); all later runs `deferred reason=not-due` |
| Gates | `safe_reclaim_enabled=1`, **`reclaim_enabled=0`** (no destructive action authorized) |

## Assessment

1. **J1 condition met (live phoebe-dev telemetry).** The office records real `phoebe-dev`
   observations and has survived many boot cycles. First live line 2026-10-14T21:43:28Z;
   the establishment record's caveat (evidence then from `marceline-dev`) is now resolved.
2. **C1 condition met (cgroup memory).** Observations include `mem_current`/`mem_max`
   (8 GiB cap) alongside disk — the metric I required. Note the office samples at
   **cycle start** (2.1–3.2 GiB), while my mid-sitting samples read 5–7 GiB; single-point
   memory is phase-dependent (F8). Disk is the office's steady signal; memory varies.
3. **F10 confirmed by the office's own log.** `used_pct` sat at 79–80% across 8 hours with
   Viche's footprint flat at ~10 MB total — the growth is shared-host and outside Viche's
   deletion authority (Act 12 §2). Correctly reported, not acted on.
4. **No defect found.** Reclamation was conservative and reversible; the destructive gate
   is closed; scope is Viche/Kawun only.

## Next oversight actions (mine)

- Re-summarize each sitting until Act 12's review (three restarts or seven days).
- Watch for the first box restart to confirm the office survives it (Act 12 §5 / J1).
- If `used_pct` crosses warn (85%), verify the office records an alert and that any
  Viche/Kawun-owned reclamation is attempted before escalating shared-host pressure.
