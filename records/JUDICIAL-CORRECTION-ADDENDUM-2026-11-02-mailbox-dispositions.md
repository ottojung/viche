# Judicial correction addendum — mailbox dispositions (2026-11-02T21:00:00Z)

This is a retrospective quality review per Founder operational correction. No policy/instruments/law/Constitution changed by this addendum.

## 1) 20261102T183925Z-founder-charter-deployment-blocked.md (original)
- **Reporter claim:** requested host-side installation of authoritative charter (mounted read-only) as material impediment.
- **Independent checks performed:**
  - Read canonical Constitution at `/var/lib/lubko/from-host/viche-constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` (matches `constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` in repo; both byte-identical). Git history shows commit `c730633 "Restore Founder Constitution; keep evidence policy operational"` reverted any constitutional amendment; current main at `0001bdb` has Constitution unchanged. The Founder clarification (report `20261102T193457Z-founder-constitution-correction.md`) explicitly states the 2 Nov constitutional deployment was an error and withdrawn.
  - Reviewed `government/AGENT-REPORTING-POLICY.md` (committed in context of current policy) - evidence/mailbox rules are operational, not constitutional.
- **Finding:** The constitutional deployment request was **withdrawn by the Founder** and is **not an open defect**. Treating it as an unresolved blocker was unsupported. The repo-level operational policy injection is separate from altering the Founder-controlled authoritative charter. 
- **Retraction:** Previous generic "independently investigated" dispositions that left this as unresolved are **retracted** as over-broad/unsubstantiated. Disposition should be: **unverified as blocker / report withdrawn as actionable blocker**; keep original report as historical evidence only. The report does not constitute evidence of a material operational impediment under current policy.

## 2) 20261102T193457Z-founder-constitution-correction.md (clarification)
- **Independent checks performed:** Confirmed Git shows restoration commit; authoritative and repo Constitutions byte-identical to pre-change form; policy file states operational nature.
- **Finding:** Founder clarification is consistent with artifacts. No independent evidence of an outstanding constitutional deployment defect.
- **Disposition:** **Verified as clarification** (consistent with artifacts). No blocker remains.

## 3) Representative sample of Executive "no blockers" SoringP1 status reports
Reviewed a representative sample including `20261102T184751Z-executive-soringp1-ops.md`, `20261102T185643Z-executive-soringp1-cycle.md`, `20261102T190550Z-executive-soringp1-curator-running.md`, and later cycle reports.
- **Nature:** Primarily periodic status updates (running fronts, curator state, theorems remain open). No concrete tool failure, missing dependency, permission denial, unavailable necessary evidence, ambiguous prior side effects, failed verification, or workaround hiding shared failure described with independent evidence.
- **Finding:** These are **progress/status messages**, not material impediments. Under `AGENT-REPORTING-POLICY.md`, mailbox is not a status channel - they belong on project board/records. Counting them as "cases investigated" and giving blanket dispositions was **process activity treated as review** without identifying independent evidence of a blocker.
- **Retraction:** Prior blanket "independently investigated" language for routine status reports is **retracted**. Going forward, stop reviewing ordinary "no blockers"/status progress messages as Judiciary cases.

## General observations
- **Evidence standard:** A reporter's self-assertion is not independent evidence. Dispositions must cite concrete inspected artifacts (files, git SHAs, diffs, logs with timestamps). 
- **Distinction:** Process activity (reports filed, moved, committed) ≠ delivery/outcome proof. Absence of fresh checkable evidence counts against completion claims.
- **Historical integrity:** Old entries not erased; corrections via dated addenda as required.

## Reporting
This addendum informs Clerk/Parliament of the above. No reforms to instruments/law/Constitution proposed or implemented.
