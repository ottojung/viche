# Judiciary addendum — Act 17 metadata correction for `e746c98e3c841cf9b1`

Linked report: `records/AUDIT-DISPOSITION-CYCLE-ec850b40-2026-11-07.md`.

The original outcome's evidence reference incorrectly labeled commit
`5c778290b07a6bffab3f9c5cdb20dbd965c11bcd` as its own tree hash. Direct Git
inspection returns tree `7c013a8749543f0c9453a63f9b7bf58f1f850420`. The
sampled commit's `records/suite-status.json` records commit
`a8b23ff95ffa06362fb221581d1a917183b5be95` and tree
`36dfea1c42984c624708c7310cb45c3ae157ab34`; this supports the existing,
narrow Act 21 gate-record finding, not a claim that tests were red. Exact-SHA
GitHub Actions success remains permitted contrary evidence to any claim of a
red test result.

Under cycle `ec850b4011d59f0493178dbe19f10028`, the Judiciary filed and
procedurally confirmed an Act 17 correction to the outcome evidence metadata;
the verdict remains `finding`. The append-only correction trail was committed
on the local Judiciary branch in `d1cff09` and `53b7112`. This is not yet in
canonical `main`, has not been merged, and is not represented as effective in
the canonical watchdog. The correction workflow's second pass is procedural,
not independent verification.

The preceding outcome text and this addendum are retained for audit history;
the corrected evidence reference is in the correction record. No merge,
deployment, or external post was performed.
