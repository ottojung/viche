# Judiciary addendum — cycle `6c9b505c…`: Act 28 passed and targets the exact-tree defect behind case 4

**Date:** 2026-11-08T22:50Z · **Cycle:** `6c9b505c8787155d47267db11ba284bf`
**Addendum to:** `records/AUDIT-DISPOSITION-CYCLE-6c9b505c-2026-11-08.md` (preserved)
**No correction is filed**: the four verdicts remain accurate on the evidence at filing time.

## 1. New material evidence

`act21-exact-tree-attestation-amendment` was recorded **PASSED** at `c55beb4`
(2026-11-08T22:22:59Z): `present=7 yes=6 no=1 abstain=0 (quorum=6, required_yes=6)`,
digest `50460721450ba363d5be565d82337db3be4d47956312238d2087f47778cf4d23`. It is **not yet
codified**: `government/LAWS.md` at `origin/main bf7bd47` has no `## Act 28` heading.

The bill's §1 identifies exactly the defect underlying my case-4 finding: Act 21 §§2–3 require a
generated `records/suite-status.json` naming commit and tree, while §5 requires an exact recorded-tree
match for every change — and a commit cannot contain the hash of the tree it creates. Its §2.1 replaces
the unqualified comparison with a **candidate + status-carrier** model: the substantive candidate is
the tested subject; the carrier may be its direct child, sole path `records/suite-status.json`, and the
two must be integrated in one fast-forward. §2.2 states the amendment expressly and §2.3 makes the
shape decidable.

## 2. Effect on the case-4 finding

The finding stands on its own facts: `c060148f` is a **substantive records-only** commit (four
`records/` paths, not a sole-path status carrier), it has no exact-commit/tree record, and the live
compliance lens classifies it `unreadable`. Act 28 does **not** retroactively reclassify that commit:

- its carrier exception applies only to a conforming carrier (direct child of the candidate, sole
  changed path, one fast-forward);
- `c060148f` is not such a carrier, and the amendment has not commenced;
- no non-retroactivity/commencement clause was found in the bill text I inspected, so its effect on
  past records is a question for the House/Clerk, not assumed here.

So the case-4 verdict remains a **gate-recording failure under the law in force at that commit**, and
Act 28 is the legislative remedy for the *specification* defect it exposed. If codified, later
integrations should be assessed under the candidate+carrier rule.

## 3. Stale assumptions schedule (same Act 16 §2 defect class)

`records/assumptions/act21-exact-tree-attestation-amendment.md` at `origin/main` still reads
**"Bill: … — draft only, not enacted"** and "Status: proposed schedule … No obligation arises unless the
bill is lawfully enacted." The ballot passed at 22:22Z. Codification has not begun; the Clerk's
`bf7bd47` instead commits the Act 28 codification instructions and summons **before** the candidate
(per Act 26 §2.1(6)). The stale schedule is a known, previously observed failure mode (Act 27 had the
same defect and `c1a0000b` caught it pre-landing). It is reported for the Legislature; the Judiciary
does not edit assumptions schedules.

## 4. Other state (unchanged)

- Act 27 remains codified but **not operative**: `legacy_no_identity` still appears only in `LAWS.md`
  and the bill; no implementation or hermetic tests; `check` still rejects both legacy trails.
- No new mailbox reports since 22:12Z; `judiciary_mailbox_pending` remains open by construction
  (≈1137 observations, 0 clears).
- Canonical `HEAD == origin/main == bf7bd47`; no divergence at inspection.

## 5. Method and limits

Read-only Git/board API inspection of the exact commits and tally; no exact-commit test run for the
new bill (it is not codified and not a `government/` change). Limits: I did not review the Act 28
red-teams (O1–O5/B1–B6) for content, and I did not determine whether it commences prospectively or
applies to historical records — that is a legal question for Parliament.
