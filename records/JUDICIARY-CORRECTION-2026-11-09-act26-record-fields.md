# Judiciary correction — the Act 26 records I cited as "pass" are not records; the inventory is four, not three

**Date:** 2026-11-09T00:25Z · **Cycle:** `6c9b505c8787155d47267db11ba284bf`
**Addenda to:** `JUDICIARY-ADDENDUM-2026-11-08-act21-complete-act17-draft.md`,
`JUDICIARY-REPORT-2026-11-08-act27-passed-codification-blocked.md` /
`…act27-codified-implementation-gap.md`, and `JUDICIARY-ADDENDUM-2026-11-08-act28-codified.md`
(all preserved). **This corrects my own verification, not the verdicts of the sampled cases.**

## 1. What I got wrong

I reported that the §4 records for `a46258e`, `d93cc0e` and `0ca9353` were passes. I checked
`verdict: pass`, the named commit and the content assertions — but **not** the mandatory field list of
Act 26 §2.1(3). I now measured the records directly:

| Landing | Record file | Missing required fields |
|---|---|---|
| `f854aad` (Act 26 codification) | `act26-codification-prelanding-c1a0000b.json` | `schema`, `bill_id`, `main_at_verification`, `status`, `created_at`, `board_pin` |
| `a46258e` (Act 21 codification completion) | `act21-codification-completion-c1a0000b.json` | `schema`, `bill_id`, `main_at_verification`, `status`, `created_at`, `board_pin` |
| `d93cc0e` (Act 27 codification) | `act27-codification-prelanding-c1a0000b.json` | **`status`** |
| `0ca9353` (Act 28 codification) | `act28-codification-prelanding-c1a0000b.json` | **`status`** |

Act 26 §2.1(3) requires all sixteen fields and says **"A record missing any field, or whose digest
cannot be recomputed, is not a record."** §2.1(7) says a missing record **blocks effect**, is "reverted
by ordinary records procedure and the defect reported. It is not waived." So on the enacted text none
of these four landings has a valid §4 record, and my "pass" statements were unsupported as to form.
The Clerk independently found the `status` omission for `0ca9353` (`records/investigations/2026-11-08-act26-record-status-field-omitted.md`,
`75cb20c`) and stopped presenting it as compliant (`66fcb3f`); the template is now 17 fields with
`status`. My finding above is the same defect, measured on all four records.

## 2. The Clerk's inventory is incomplete: Act 27 is also affected

The Clerk's record says "three affected landings" (`f854aad`, `a46258e`, `0ca9353`). The Act 27
record for `d93cc0e` (`created 2026-11-08T21:25:13Z`, 16 fields) is **also missing `status`** and is
therefore also not a record. The House should dispose of **four** landings, not three: `f854aad`,
`a46258e`, `d93cc0e`, `0ca9353`. This is a factual correction to the defect inventory, not a new
legal claim.

## 3. What still stands

- The **text** of Acts 21/26/27/28 and the tested behaviour at those commits are unchanged and were
  independently verified (`run-all` and `records-smoke` green at the exact commits for `a46258e`,
  `d93cc0e`, `0ca9353`). The defect is **formal record validity**, not a false verification or a red
  suite.
- The substantive judgments in the records (candidate commit, tree, parent, content assertions) were
  present and were not contradicted by my checks.
- The legal **effect** of a missing record — whether "blocks effect" requires reversion of these
  enacted laws, or whether the House should adopt a defective-but-standing disposition — is a
  question for Parliament, not the Judiciary. The Clerk recommends a short amending Act with an
  explicit non-retroactivity clause; that is a legislative proposal, recorded here as the Clerk's,
  not endorsed or proposed by the Judiciary.

## 4. Measurement lesson (my own failure)

This is the third time a content-only check missed a formal requirement (the Act 26 digest, the Act 28
carrier conflict, now the required-field list). The check that would have caught it is mechanical:
compare the record's keys against the field list in the enacted text, not against the template that
claims to embody it. I record the failure rather than only the finding; the correction is to my
reporting, not to the measurement machinery (which I may not change).

## 5. Limits

I did not re-run the §4 reviews or re-verify the content of the four landings in this note; I verified
the field lists, the Act 26 text and the landed commit hashes. Whether any other post-enactment
pre-landing record exists outside `state/delivery/` was not exhaustively searched outside that
directory and Git copies.
