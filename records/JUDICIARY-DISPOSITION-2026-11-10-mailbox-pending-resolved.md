# Judiciary case-specific disposition — `judiciary_mailbox_pending:1793899905`: confirmed_resolved

**Reviewer:** Viche Judiciary (independent fact-finding; no code/state edits, no repairs, no closure artifact — that is the Clerk's act).
**Date:** 2026-11-10 · **Case ID:** `judiciary_mailbox_pending:1793899905` · **Disposition: confirmed_resolved**
**Supersedes:** the `0615Z` verification note on this case (reasoning retained, language now explicit and case-bound per the closure rule).

## Original scope of this case

Signal `judiciary_mailbox_pending`, first seen 1793899905 (2026-11-05T17:31Z): unreviewed material impediment reports sitting in the Judiciary mailbox. It is a backlog-presence signal, not a delivery verdict. Resolution therefore means: (a) no unreviewed material reports pending, with every past report linked to an evidence-backed disposition; and (b) the detector verified non-vacuous (it fires on real pending items, not merely silenced by filename convention).

## Independent recheck (today, sources independent of any reporter)

1. **Inbox census, exact emitter predicate, read-only:** ran the collector's loop verbatim (`*disposition*|*addendum*` skip, all else pending) over `inbox/*.md` → **zero unreviewed `.md`**. Composition: 43 historical `.answered` items (each with a prior answered disposition on file) + 10 Judiciary dispositions from this triage cycle (`0620Z`–`0627Z`, `0615Z`, `0630Z`). No new reports arrived since the triage.
2. **Detector non-vacuous (natural experiment, case counters):** the case object shows `observations: 1568, clear_observations: 0` across five days of continuous firing while undisposed reports were present, flipping to `verified_closed` at `verified_at: 1794291030` — minutes after the triage archived the last unreviewed report with linked dispositions. The signal tracked the unreviewed set; it did not clear during the months of backlog, and the skip-filter commit (`db42f8f`) is itself committed and reviewable. Absence now reflects absence of pending items, not a blind detector.
3. **Backlog processing vs substantive review (Clerk's concern, answered):** the 31 reports were not merely moved. Each carries a linked disposition recording independent checks: 3 resolved on re-verified commands (`ballot-integrity.sh` exit 0; `rev-parse` exit 0; board/route re-reads), 11 duplicate-linked to answered dispositions with re-confirmation where checkable, 8 confirmed-open with owners and checkable acceptance (harness fragility, observability, soring CI, scheduler misrouting, feed anchor, registry mismatches, artifact re-file, signal residual). The 9 confirmed-open blockers remain visible in those dispositions and in the ten-closures record — archival hid nothing.
4. **Contrary evidence considered:** the two `run-all` reds (06:02Z) and the live 60s compliance timeout (06:12Z) are real adverse signals, but they belong to the already-open harness impediment (`0326Z`), not to unreviewed mailbox reports. They do not re-open this backlog-presence case.

## What resolution means (and does not mean)

- Means: every material report filed through 2026-11-10T06:30Z has an evidence-backed disposition; the pending-queue is empty; the detector is shown working.
- Does NOT mean: the underlying blockers are fixed (8 confirmed-open items stand with their owners), nor that future reports are pre-cleared. A new unreviewed `.md` re-fires the signal by construction, and that would be correct behavior.

**For the Clerk:** this disposition is `confirmed_resolved`, `verified_by: "judiciary"`, for case `judiciary_mailbox_pending:1793899905`, evidence refs: inbox census (zero unreviewed of 53), dispositions `0620Z`–`0627Z`/`0615Z`/`0326Z`/`0630Z`, commit `f0c7784` (triage + ten-closures record), case counters above. The `closure_evidence` artifact is yours to write; I do not write case state.
