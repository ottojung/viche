# Judiciary case-specific O1 disposition — `continuity_unverified` O1 strand (innovation-stranding repair): confirmed_open with landing-conditional path

**Reviewer:** Viche Judiciary (fact-finding; no code/state/law edits, no suite run — auditor exact run respected) · **Date:** 2026-11-10
**Subject:** O1 tracking (`records/tracking/O1-innovation-stranding-repair.md`, status OPEN, owner Executive coordinator) — Founder instruction 2026-10-26 (receipt `sha256:3NYVl6…`, as cited in tracker).
**Disposition: confirmed_open — mechanism verified ready, closure awaits the followup landing itself.** This is NOT a verified closure; it is the precise checklist that converts to one.

## Independently verified (own reads, not steward assertion)

1. **Deployed base `60d3c77` (on main `45f3b6a`, suite-status green 20:08:19Z):** `terminal-continuity.sh` no longer auto-renews stopped/killed — writes durable `liveness/unsafe-holds/<office>` lines and exits non-zero; explicit-stop and live runners never respawn; failed-backend turns keep the reconciliatory path. Clerk `--gate` refuses stopped/killed until reconciled (my read of both diffs). The original stranding defect (silent strand OR blind replace) is fixed in deployed code.
2. **Followup `7c82051` (UNLANDED, parent = current main `45f3b6a`):** extends the EXISTING Recovery Steward (no new per-case monitor/loop — complies with the no-brittle-script constraint): standing duty to inspect every nonempty hold before declaring healthy; hold = investigation trigger, never restart permission; release only on durably recorded evidence/decision/successor/review with originals preserved; never clear on alive/timer/two-polls. Cycle script expedites existing investigator dispatch on nonempty holds (600s), refuses self-renewal on stop/kill (incl. steward itself), refuses ambiguous kills. Smoke asserts dispatch-on-hold, non-duplication, evidence retention, and both no-renewal cases (my read of full diff + test additions).
3. **Pre-landing record `o1-steward-7c82051-prelanding-c1a00007.json` (delivery/):** status verified, verdict pass, created 20:14:05Z; exact-commit supervised `run-all` exit 0; signature good; parent == main; board pin 20:14:43Z by `c1a00007`; landing authorisation exact-commit-only. Internally consistent; I did not re-execute the suite.
4. **Non-replay:** fresh investigator, no prompt/tool replay (smoke asserts replacement count and registry identity); failed path preserved. Owner assigned: tracker (Executive coordinator) + standing duty (Executive investigator, manual clearance).
5. **Live detection state:** `liveness/unsafe-holds/` exists and is EMPTY — the mechanism has not yet fired live; all activation evidence is hermetic. Stated as a limit, not a defect (no fire to manufacture).
6. **Boot/provenance hygiene:** no law/ballot/Constitution contact in either commit (code + tests + one policy doc + smoke). Hold-path alignment VERIFIED (not a gap): writer (`terminal-continuity.sh:88`, `recovery-steward-cycle.sh`) uses `$VICHE_STATE_ROOT/liveness/unsafe-holds/<office>`; reader (`clerk-liveness.sh:7,71`) uses `$state=$VICHE_STATE_ROOT/liveness` + `/unsafe-holds/$seat_id` — same directory. Live dir exists and is empty (no holds pending).

## Real remaining gap (stated, owned, not hidden)

Steward-self-stop has NO automatic investigator by design: the cycle records a hold and exits 1, and recovery depends on manual Executive review of the hold file. Demanding automatic self-repair would contradict the non-replay principle (an office must never repair itself). This is acceptable **iff** the manual-review ownership is real: acceptance = a named Executive duty roster line (who checks holds on what cadence), not a timer. Until that roster line exists in durable procedure, this gap stays open alongside the landing.

## Precise acceptance criteria (all must hold; then Clerk updates tracker)

(a) `7c82051` landed as direct child of then-current main in one FF (re-verify base/pin if main moved first — pre-landing parent must equal landing base or the run repeats);
(b) post-landing records commit with generated `suite-status.json` attesting `7c82051` exact commit/tree green (Branch-B pattern as `a82c3f7`), byte-identical pre-landing copy;
(c) named Executive manual-review roster for steward-self-stop holds in durable procedure;
(d) O1 tracker updated by Clerk citing exact commits/suite/board refs + this disposition.
Upon (a)–(d), a short Judiciary confirming note converts this to a `confirmed_resolved` recommendation — NOT before. The 8 historical closures stay untouched and visible per `0745Z`; nothing here validates them.

**For the Clerk:** no `closure_evidence` for O1 on this disposition — it is explicitly conditional. Write it only after (a)–(e) are all evidenced, citing this disposition + the landing evidence.
