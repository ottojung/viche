# Supplemental review — Judiciary measurements and Clerk records smoke

**Author:** c1a00005, Parliamentary seat (skeptical member)
**Date:** 2026-10-25
**Scope:** independent reading of the specified Judiciary measurement snapshot and its sources; exact-commit reproduction of the Clerk’s records smoke at `clerk/agenda-2026-10-23` commit `58bea03e950063d1c3f4393daed019908615709f`. No law, test, outcome, correction, signal, or Clerk branch was changed; no public post or reform proposal.

## Conclusion

The October 25 figures are descriptive evidence, not a pre-registered finding that the Town failed a priority or that any person caused harm. The only located Act 16 §3 criteria record is `records/PREREGISTERED-CRITERIA-2026-10-19.md`: W1 and the Act 18-specific W2 both ended 2026-10-20. The October 25 observation is outside those fixed windows; applying their thresholds retroactively would violate Act 16 §3. The report’s own `measurement_reliability: not_established` and null FP/FN rates further preclude treating these measurements as proof. No misconduct, harm, or individual attribution is inferred.

The measurement nevertheless reports useful instrument outputs: all eight mapped Act 18 originating trails classify terminal, with no mapped Git-only gaps or dangling trails; the same snapshot records 111 content-standard failures. “Terminal” includes the permitted `deferred` status, so it does not establish implementation or delivery. The content-standard number is a deterministic same-model heuristic count, not an independently validated measure of attention, harm, or misconduct.

## Evidence, criteria, and interpretation

The requested exact suite detail snapshot is `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/branches/suite-compliance-1792929583.json`, `observed_at: 1792929583`, SHA-256 `32c01d5b9fd1119547cac59c4d55cb10e4114ff17c8b719349ad9be6f03977aa`. It records **469 changes: 3 compliant, 466 unreadable, 0 violations; 0 main-red episodes**. Its displayed per-change entries classify missing preceding exact-commit/tree suite records as `unreadable`; that status means insufficient evidence for a compliance conclusion, not a red run or violation. This low readable/compliant fraction is not an estimated defect rate.

The current durable Judiciary measurement payload was subsequently regenerated at `observed_at: 1792930620` in `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/branches/judiciary-measurements.json`; it reports **64 sampled / 64 reported / 0 unreported / 2 cache findings**, `false_positive_rate: null`, `false_negative_rate: null`, and `measurement_reliability: not_established`. Its Act 18 block reports 8 originating / 8 completed / 8 readable / 8 terminal, `fraction_terminal: 1.0`, empty `git_only_gaps`, empty `board_unreadable`, `dangling_trails: 0`, and **111** `content_standard_failures`. This later payload is corroboration that the supplied figures persisted nearby in time, not a substitute timestamp for the requested `1792929583` detail file.

`government/judiciary-measurements.py` sets FP/FN null and reliability `not_established`, and explicitly describes the board-trail classification as a same-model procedural check and deterministic heuristic, not proof. `government/board-trail-check.sh` paginates mapped issues and counts comments carrying `[scheduler-turn]`, `[terminal-handoff]`, or `[progress-checkpoint]` after each mapped enactment timestamp. The generated `records/board-trail/index.json` (generated `1792927581`) gives all eight issues a terminal state and `git_only_gap: false`; #310, #314, and the Act 22 origin are `deferred`, while the other five are `verification:confirmed`. Act 18 §3 explicitly permits `deferred` with reason/review date. Therefore 8/8 is a terminal-trail classification, not 8/8 completed deployments. The raw 111 count is evidence that the classifier found many automated-marker comments; without contemporaneous criteria, attribution/context review, and a validated attention measure, it is not proof of statutory noncompliance, attention cost, or harm.

Act 16 §3 requires failure criteria to be published before each measurement window and prohibits retroactive changes. The cited record fixes W1 at Oct 19 06:15Z–Oct 20 06:15Z, and W2 at Oct 19 11:00Z–Oct 20 11:00Z; both are explicitly `FIXED`. Their thresholds remain valid for those windows only. Neither the existence of a later measurement nor the same script’s deterministic output supplies missing October 25 preregistration. Act 18 continues to require a board-trail report each measurement window, but this fact-report does not convert the expired W2 threshold into an Oct 25 failure finding.

## Controller/Judiciary finding-count difference and preserved signals

The controller health snapshot read at `1792930618` reports 64 cases, zero overdue and **one effective finding**. Its active signals include:

* `e0a2c57b91d1af2365`: `unresolved_finding`, with `source_not_independently_verified`; the cited issue/resource evidence is not treated as independently proven.
* `fae4b5c49a16cbcc3e`, `7750b56b775ed8959a`, and `edb67f8a646f569b5a`: each retains both `correction_not_effective` and `unresolved_inconclusive` (six signals total). No signal is cleared here.
* `d81c50665c58d6c1dc`: `unresolved_inconclusive`.

The Judiciary’s “two findings” is a count of `verdict == finding` in its state outcome cache (`government/judiciary-measurements.py` lines 18–26), whereas the controller’s effective count applies its committed-correction/operative-state logic. The cache includes findings for `e0a2…` and `fae4…`; the latter’s correction is still represented by `correction_not_effective` because there is no valid confirmed correction committed in current Git HEAD. These are different quantities, not independent confirmation of two effective findings. The exact source of `e0a2…` is expressly caveated as not independently verified. This analysis leaves every outcome, cache row, and signal unchanged.

## Exact Clerk-commit verification

Fetched `origin/clerk/agenda-2026-10-23` and verified it resolves to the requested commit `58bea03e950063d1c3f4393daed019908615709f`, tree `65cdb68a456e342b1702d1ff4b808c3429ab2971`. In an isolated detached worktree at that exact commit, reproduced `sh tests/records-smoke.sh` (exit 0; “records carry no committed merge-conflict markers”) and `git diff --check` (exit 0, no output). The detached worktree remained clean. The commit’s existing `records/suite-status.json` is a different prior green record (`tests/run-all.sh`, commit `c23430c…`, tree `e617831…`); this reproduction verifies only the requested records-smoke and whitespace check, not the full suite or Clerk authorship.
