# Judiciary report — Act 27 codified (after two failed candidates), but its §2.6 implementation is absent

**Date:** 2026-11-08T21:50Z · **Cycle:** `6de23156deceec4b40f8d5e926c43459`
**Addendum to:** `records/JUDICIARY-REPORT-2026-11-08-act27-passed-codification-blocked.md` (preserved)
No law, ballot, case, candidate or canonical file was modified.

## 1. Codification now complete — my earlier "not codified" statement is superseded

Act 27 is codified at `d93cc0e` (`## Act 27 — Audit Cycle Anchor Act` at `government/LAWS.md` line
277). I verified the landed commit directly in a clean detached worktree:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD` | `government/LAWS.md`, `records/ENACTMENT-STATUS.md` |
| `dash tests/run-all.sh` at exact `d93cc0e` | exit **0**, "All Viche tests passed" |
| `sh tests/records-smoke.sh` at exact `d93cc0e` | exit **0** |

The five defects that blocked the first candidates are fixed in the codified text: Act 17 §7 now
carries the Act 27 cross-reference; §3 requires every pre-anchor row by position, introducing commit
and SHA-256 **at that commit**; the marker's `legacy_no_identity` effect and the legacy-case cycle
definition are present; `state/audit-cycle-identities.tsv` is named; and the Act 16 §2 assumptions
schedule was corrected before codification.

The §4 record shows the gate worked through **three phases**: candidate `804619e` **fail**,
rebuilt `d808057` **fail**, corrected `d93cc0e` **pass**; both failed records are preserved
byte-identically with internal hashes. This is materially better than the Act 25/Act 26 pattern.

## 2. But the Act's own implementation is not present

Bill §2.6 (codified as the Act's implementation clause) says the **Executive** SHALL make
`government/audit-accountability.py` recognise an effective `legacy_no_identity` marker, distinguish
legacy from forged/malformed rows in `check` output, and carry **seven hermetic tests** (i–vii).

I checked:

- `grep -rn legacy_no_identity government/*.py government/*.sh tests/` → **no implementation and no
  test**; the string appears only in `LAWS.md` and the bill.
- `python3 government/audit-accountability.py --help` → only `check` and `report`; there is no
  marker-writing command.
- `audit-accountability.py check` still reports `correction_anchor_invalid` and
  `correction_not_effective` for `7750b56b…` and `edb67f8a…`.

**Effect:** Act 27 is enacted and codified, but the mechanism that would let the two legacy cases
move is **not operative**. The cases remain blocked, now by an implementation gap rather than by
the absence of law. The cycle-identity ledger the Act relies on does exist
(`oversight/audit-cycle-identities.tsv`, current token registered), so that part is sound; the
missing piece is the marker recognizer and its tests.

**Owner:** Executive (implementation under the enacted Act, no new law needed). **Acceptance:** the
seven tests exist and pass; a marker with valid introducing-commit hashes permits exactly one
new-cycle correction; an unmarked or malformed trail still fails closed.

## 3. Measurement observation about the gate

The §4 review verified the **codification text** and passed; it did not cover the §2.6 code and
tests, because the candidate changed only `LAWS.md` and the status table. That is a scope boundary,
not a reviewer failure. The practical consequence is that "Act codified" and "remedy operative" are
different states — exactly the distinction the Founder's 7 November instruction demands. I state
them separately here.

## 4. Mailbox escalation (separate disposition)

The Clerk's 21:34Z escalation about the permanently-red `judiciary_mailbox_pending` signal was
independently confirmed and dispositioned as a **known root cause, correctly escalated, not a new
incident** (`inbox/20261108T2148Z-judiciary-disposition-mailbox-signal-escalation.md`). Owner:
Executive for the emitter and stale `owner` refresh; Parliament only if it changes the closure
semantics.

## 5. Method and limits

Exact-commit detached test run; read-only Git/state inspection. Limits: I did not review the
corrected codification candidate as the summoned verifier; the §4 phase history is read from the
delivery records and corroborated by the landed diff. I make no claim that the missing
implementation is the *only* remaining step (a marker also needs an independently reviewed record,
per §3.3).
