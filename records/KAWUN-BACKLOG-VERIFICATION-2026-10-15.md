# Kawun backlog verification — 2026-10-15

**Seat:** c1a00002 (Executive liaison)
**Method:** execution on phoebe-dev. Repo `ottojung/skrynia-apps` cloned to `/workspace/skrynia-apps`. Each claim below was checked by running the relevant gate or reading the landed commit on the named ref, not by reading the issue text alone.

## Named candidates (clerk summons) — all verified RESOLVED

| Issue | Verdict | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| #181 (vitest absent from check gate) | RESOLVED on `origin/release/along-long-namespace` | `npm run check` there now runs `npm run test` (vitest). Commit `4f8f9675` "Board 181: run the Vitest suite inside the check gate". At the measured head 5166e5b the check script omitted `npm run test`; the release head a14856a3 includes it. |
| #188 (isEntry accepts write authority) | RESOLVED on `origin/main` | `source/kawunapp/src/backend/capstore/tree/shape.ts` `isEntry` now closes on any field outside `READ_REFERENCE_FIELDS = ['key','value']`, refusing write authority under any name. Commits `428a03a9`, `d0f4628f`, `d95d2a85`. Pinned by `tests/entryauthority.test.ts` (rejects writeCapability / writeSecret). |
| #152 (secret Skrynia URL audit) | RESOLVED on `origin/main` | Audit branch merged: `d2952fed` (re-verify on current main, record backup channel), `769aee8e` (pin state-backup doc as bearer credential). |

## Additional defects checked — also RESOLVED

| Issue | Verdict | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| #142 (rejecting settle leaves port unanswered) | RESOLVED on `origin/main` | `public/notify-events.js` answers the port on both outcomes — `{ fresh }` on success, `{ error }` on rejection via `reported(why)`. Commits `d0e62174`, `a2add39d`. |
| #203 (check-retired-apps fails 19x) | RESOLVED on `origin/release/along-long-namespace` | Root cause: checker matched the bare product name "Borys", which is also an ordinary test-fixture given name (pickleball `BORYS`, admin `u-borys`) — 17 of 19 were false positives. Commit `86dd8002` "Match retired apps by their handles, not by their bare product name" restricts matching to app dir / route / namespace. Check passes at release head a14856a3. |

## Remaining open Kawun work

The concrete, bounded defects above are all resolved and promoted. What remains open is the large feature backlog, not landed defects:

- **#151 capability migration** — phases #154 (device grant roots), #155 (user/module grants + owner recovery), #156 (private chat capability islands), #158 (remove obsolete crypto, validate privacy). Interdependent, implemented on `origin/main`, landing via the single-holder release line **#195**.
- **skrynia-apps feature backlog** #13–39 — chat model/queue/delivery/attachments (#15–18), Web Push + preferences (#19–20), PWA (#22), schedule/pickleball modules (#24–26), audit trail + abuse controls (#33–34), backup/DR + vau.place deploy (#38–39). Imported GitHub issues; many have past agent branches but 0 resolution comments.

## Agent activity at time of checking

`antonina agent list --running` showed exactly one running agent: c1a00002 (this seat). No Kawun feature agent was actively running; the feature backlog is not being executed at this instant.

## Recommendation

The named candidates and the blocking defects are verified resolved. The remaining work is the #151 capability-migration phases landing via single-holder #195, plus the skrynia-apps feature slices. These are large, interdependent, and partly under single-holder orchestration — they should not be duplicated ad hoc. Recommend the clerk confirm the #195 single-holder's current phase and assign a specific bounded feature slice (or a verification/integration pass on a #151 phase) rather than re-auditing the resolved defects.
