## 11. Why #195 is a feature rebuild, not a port (measured 2026-10-16)

Board-13's missing module is `src/grants/policy/` (9 files, ~742 lines). I copied it
onto `origin/main` on a scratch branch and ran `tsc -p config/tsconfig.json`:

```
src/grants/policy/derive.ts(20,33): Property 'entries' does not exist on type 'Reachable'
src/grants/policy/entry.ts(3,3):  no exported member 'isResourceCapability' (main has 'isModuleCapability')
src/grants/policy/entry.ts(38,47): Property 'module' does not exist on type 'CapabilityEntry'
src/grants/policy/entry.ts(39,23): Property 'resource' does not exist on type 'CapabilityEntry'
src/grants/policy/policy.ts(2,10): no exported member 'isScopeName'
src/grants/policy/scope.ts(2,27):  no exported member 'RESOURCE_KIND'
```

So the release's `policy/` is coupled to the release line's `grants/record`
model, which main does not have. Landing board-13 on main is a **feature rebuild
against main's record model** (plus its admin UI/tests), not a mechanical port or
merge. The scratch branch was deleted; nothing changed.

This makes the #195 determination definitive: neither a wholesale merge nor a
drop-in port works. Deliver board-13 only as a deliberate feature front if the
Founder wants the config-driven permission-policy feature; otherwise close #195.
