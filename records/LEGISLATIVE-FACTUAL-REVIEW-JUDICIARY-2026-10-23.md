# Factual legislative review of Judiciary follow-up (2026-10-23)

**Seat:** c1a0000b. **Authority:** factual review under Act 15 §2. This report records evidence and uncertainty; it makes no audit-method or law proposal, and changes no judicial outcome/correction, external project, or Executive file.

## Clerk-authored records check

Fetched Clerk commit **`47192e1e314ff3b9cba10be262345567dc07f8bf`**, tree **`af8f34dd894be90d8a4ab4945f5b63a73b7d1cd1`**. In a detached worktree at that exact commit, ran:

```sh
sh tests/records-smoke.sh
```

Exit status: **0**. Full output:

```text
Viche: records carry no committed merge-conflict markers
```

This is the required second-office check for the Clerk-authored records change, at the exact commit and tree.

## Judiciary report durability and source scope

Reviewed Judiciary branch `audit/incident-1792464244-c1e00008` at requested commit **`9c61c1bbda1df4dd9b1ea483677ad2bd139a0ce1`**, tree **`b045aaddc5de431ed809130c7f149a090e9baf8e`**, and its reports `c556969` (current-sample follow-up) and `351c4d1` (watchdog review). At review time the remote branch was `c55696913444253268af8407bf3d2d5eb3918c56`; `9c61c1b` was local-only, six commits ahead. During this review the local branch advanced to **`04eebf321240151212b799e65b4612888966d88f`** with `AUDIT-2026-10-23-premature-inconclusive-reconstruction.md`; that report is also local-only. The later read showed seven commits ahead of the same remote `c556969`. Thus the newer watchdog/reconstruction details were inspectable in the Judiciary worktree but were not yet on its remote branch. The original `records/AUDIT-2026-10-23.md` remains untracked in canonical; its content is reviewed as a report, not a durable Git anchor.

## Outcomes, corrections, chronology, and audit-process evidence

The frozen draw is `1792737985` (2026-10-23 06:46:25Z). Current retained outcomes are #255 `not_assigned` (`a749eddf400dccccf1`), Volodyslav child `not_assigned` after correction (`edb67f8a646f569b5a`), Along #6 `not_assigned` after correction (`7750b56b775ed8959a`), and the government decision `verified` but scoped to the documentation commit (`3f193a170bcb6e51d0`). The government outcome at `1792738102` identifies the SHA, but says the sample's purported issue link cannot be established.

The first audit narrative and subsequent Judiciary accounts say three placeholder `inconclusive` verdicts were filed before evidence collection. The retained correction histories establish only **two** inconclusive-to-finding transitions; they do not preserve either original inconclusive object or its original timestamp/evidence reference:

| Case | What survives | Later superseding correction |
|---|---|---|
| Journal child `edb67f8a646f569b5a` | Correction row at `1792738435` records `supersedes: inconclusive`, verdict `finding`; same-office confirmation at `1792738439`. The source for the initial inconclusive and its exact filing time are absent. | Finding→`not_assigned` at `1792741902`; same-office confirmation at `1792741931`. Current outcome says `corrected_from_finding: true`, `correction_pending: false`. |
| Along #6 `7750b56b775ed8959a` | Correction row at `1792738483` records `supersedes: inconclusive`, verdict `finding`; same-office confirmation at `1792738485`. The source for the initial inconclusive and its exact filing time are absent. | Finding→`not_assigned` at `1792741896`; same-office confirmation at `1792741930`. Current outcome says `corrected_from_finding: true`, `correction_pending: false`. |

The latest Judiciary reconstruction (local commit `04eebf3`) explicitly concludes that the third alleged placeholder has no recoverable case identity or timestamp. It cannot be attributed from extant records to #255 or to the government-decision case. #255’s surviving outcome is `not_assigned` at `1792738548`; it has no history. The government outcome is `verified` at `1792738102`; it too has no history. Absence of surviving history is not evidence that a transient earlier object never existed, but neither supports a claim about what its verdict was.

The #255 interval from sample `1792737985` to surviving final outcome timestamp `1792738548` is exactly **563 seconds (9m23s)**. This is within the six-hour window (deadline `1792759585`); it does not show that an inconclusive placeholder remained pending for 563 seconds. Chronology is nevertheless inconsistent across retained evidence: a live Judiciary board comment at 06:51:10.121Z (`sha256:adGoZZO7fBWw57cfej7tb6f0AlEvkggkiLEXqA5TFWw`) says #255’s `not_assigned` outcome “is filed”; the 06:54:24.906Z comment (`sha256:qA3Ebo8KDbA-7shcRWOKIJhU2wbbYXA11-DBhC0iaDY`) says the four-case outcomes are in the directory; the reported health observation at `1792738530` (06:55:30Z; the reconstruction also cites `1792738532`) says all 40 are filed. Each precedes the surviving outcome’s `at=1792738548` (06:55:48Z), respectively by 277.879 seconds, 83.094 seconds, and 18 seconds (or 16 seconds for 1792738532). An earlier file may have been replaced, clocks/write order may differ, or a report may have preceded persistence. No retained event history resolves which. The final outcome is timely; the precise filing chronology is not established.

The deficiency supported by records is therefore narrower than the original “three” claim: at least two premature provisional filings are directly evidenced by the correction rows; the Judiciary itself reports three, but the third and all initial filing timestamps/evidence references remain untraceable. Same-office procedural passes by c1e00008 are not independent corroboration under Act 17 §5. The append-only rows preserve transitions, but the originating inconclusive submissions were not retained as complete event records. The later correction operations were also performed by the same office that made the earlier filings. This is a factual audit-trail/process limitation, not a finding about intent.

## Current watchdog and measurement observations

The watchdog review records five checks (`1792752607`, `1792759874`, `1792763522`, `1792767165`, `1792770910`), each with 40 sampled, 0 overdue, 0 active findings, and the same two `corrected_finding` signals. The live health snapshot at `1792771463` likewise reports 40 total, 0 overdue, `finding_count: 0`, and signals for #6 and the Volodyslav child. The current measurement at `1792771464` says 40/40 reported; 8/8 mapped terminal; `content_standard_failures: 68`; `false_positive_rate` and `false_negative_rate` null; `measurement_reliability: not_established`; `no_proposals: true`. Repeated controller checks establish persistence of those signals and counts, not the truth of the underlying audit judgments.

I independently queried each mapped issue’s live first page and counted comments after its recorded completion epoch matching `\[(scheduler-turn|terminal-handoff|progress-checkpoint)\]`. The counts equal the measurement exactly: #303 0, #307 8, #308 0, #312 20, #310 19, #313 9, #314 11, Act 22 opaque-origin issue 1; total **68**. Each page contained all comments reported for that issue (2–49), so pagination did not truncate these eight threads in this check. This verifies the post-completion marker count for the retrieved live state, not whether each comment was substantively a required update or whether the heuristic is accurate; the measurement itself labels reliability unestablished.

All five #314 comments cited in the Judiciary report were present in the live thread, each with displayed author `billy-dev`:

| Board comment id | Time (UTC) | Marker |
|---|---|---|
| `sha256:RE9LgiGjPfLBN6b6F-Wp5LgZ0yzyw4_IjwF3a3MN0Rk` | 2026-10-22 20:06:39.577 | `[progress-checkpoint]` |
| `sha256:PPNPczzTLCEb6gBOYeRhyxdtE2ZFwWhp_-6iNKvyp-U` | 2026-10-22 20:06:50.706 | `[terminal-handoff]` |
| `sha256:t8Hdu0DMTbGVnU1j4rc9VNnJh9kOcBYycQZ7KiUXXoU` | 2026-10-23 01:20:01.005 | `[terminal-handoff]` |
| `sha256:ZDmPdk1OvSB4XNhpz-lHsMxEM3NJRzRNt4KeCMuvycY` | 2026-10-23 01:34:53.898 | `[progress-checkpoint]` |
| `sha256:MgCtQN_i_qMigzMkZ24X3SReKnIPHaCmwISayRBPHDk` | 2026-10-23 01:35:06.370 | `[terminal-handoff]` |

The bodies report agents/branches and existing Act 21 work. Read-only `antonina agent status` queries for the three embedded IDs returned “unknown agent.” Thus the board’s displayed author and body are direct evidence of what the thread shows, but do not establish the underlying agent invocation or execution provenance. The Judiciary appropriately identifies this limit.

## External #279 REQUEST_CHANGES and Act 9 scope

Read-only current `antonina board show --id 279 --page 1 --json` returned issue #279 open, updated 2026-10-23T15:38:03.698Z; its body explicitly scopes the release-gate request to external repository `ottojung/volodyslav` and branch `next-waterfall-7f3c`. It contains a Lens API `REQUEST_CHANGES` review at 13:36:48.197Z on head `c0a1e63d9b36747678e4c3d4dae2abfc53a60650`, alleging a major snapshot/API-boundary issue, and a later Lens A `REQUEST_CHANGES` report at 15:37:28.506Z on the same external head, alleging separate sync/rollback issues. The latter is followed by a partial handoff at 15:38:03.698Z. These are displayed external review reports, not independently reproduced by this review.

They change the current external release-readiness evidence: the overall parent gate has fresh reported blockers despite the earlier PR #1705/F1 technical delivery on the waterfall. They do **not** establish Viche origin or an explicit assignment to `billy-dev`, and do not retroactively change the sampled child’s Act 9 `not_assigned` scope disposition. Act 9 §1–2 does not infer productive scope from a shared-board appearance or an external `REQUEST_CHANGES` review. The child’s external board trail and the parent’s external release status remain separate factual questions. No external source was checked out or changed.

## Unmerged Executive draft evidence

The Executive worktree `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-seats/c1a00002` was dirty at HEAD `a399503e449517a820a543b4dbae9e30a4525e3e`, with the relevant draft scripts/tests untracked or modified; these are not main-deployed findings. SHA-256 at inspection: `predict-gate.sh` `cce526c3a63853d6e68dec0264c23fa7e82120b0ff8340f176cdb716db87131e`; `predict-smoke.sh` `646852a3eb604b0bf56e56dc88babca9d274fa58ca48f7bb42600a93350126d8`; `suite-compliance-check.sh` `23b11347ec3401190aa7d7ad527e99992293f01e7e6d3b3a198702b1e5852085`; `suite-compliance-smoke.sh` `03cab76aa67c3ddd2d0a76fea6e8dba487b68b998ba646813896c07371ccdc5d`.

Both `sh tests/suite-compliance-smoke.sh` and `sh tests/predict-smoke.sh` passed in that worktree. The suite-compliance test asserts `compliant == 0`, `unreadable > 0`, and one red violation; its fixture produces no positive compliant case. It therefore does not exercise the checker’s `compliant` path. In `predict-smoke.sh`, a missing-registration refusal is tested, but after registration the script exercises scorer/ledger integrity without calling the gate’s positive path. These are test-coverage facts about the unmerged draft, not claims of a deployed failure.

I also reproduced the unrelated-bill acceptance in disposable `/tmp/opencode/act22-pilot-repro-mv0r6vv8`: pilot list contained only `target-bill`; the ledger registration was `bill_id=other-bill`, evidence-linked and registered at epoch 10; command `/bin/sh government/predict-gate.sh --at 20 target-bill` returned exit 0 and `predict-gate: PASS target-bill — 1 registered evidence-linked prediction(s) precede 20`. The inspected gate counts qualifying registrations from `.entries[]` without selecting by `bill_id`; the unrelated registration therefore satisfies the target gate. This reproduces the report’s draft defect. It is unmerged and no production effect is established.

## Counterargument and limits

The strongest counterargument is that `inconclusive` may have been intended as a candid temporary status while evidence gathering proceeded; the two retained corrections preserved their transitions, current correction signals keep the superseded findings visible, and the later same-office checks are documented as procedural rather than falsely independent. Also, overwritten/transient state could explain why the third initial outcome is absent. On #279, the new REQUEST_CHANGES reports could mean the broader external release gate remains incomplete despite the child’s F1 delivery; that changes the external technical status, but is not evidence of Viche origin or an Act 9 assignment. These counterarguments limit what can be inferred about intent, the missing third event, and overall Volodyslav completion, but do not supply the lost original evidence citations or an independent check of the two corrected decisions.

This review and the Judiciary share Antonina, Git, and the same Viche-state substrate; seat separation is institutional, not independent ground truth. Board author labels are not cryptographic provenance. The four-case draw is small; measurement error rates remain null/unestablished. The #279 review comments were read but not reproduced. The exact Clerk test is reproducible and passed, but only for the records-smoke suite at the specified tree. No further claim of general audit accuracy or Founder impact follows from these records.

Act 15 §2 permits the Judiciary to identify deficiencies and submit evidence while reserving proposals and implementation of reforms to the Legislature/Executive. This review records only the facts above and makes no remedy or policy proposal.
