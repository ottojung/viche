# Factual review: PR #34 source-evidence archive (2026-10-23)

Reviewed PR #34 `Archive byte-exact pre-anchor audit correction evidence for PR #32`, head **`98141b2f13ef051318ef0ad35aa9a71a18b795f6`**, tree **`8c81f2683f7e9f2a0c78a290fc16ed13ad66d71b`**. The commit signature verifies as good for Otto Jung (local GPG trust unknown). GitHub API reported PR #34 open/unmerged, base commit `7c6c0ee1b8be5b7099c081e04492c06c708d0750`. Its diff adds four files only under `records/oversight/source-evidence/2026-10-23/`; it changes no operative correction path, outcome, ballot, or law.

## Byte and manifest comparison

I compared the archive against the currently untracked canonical files at `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche/records/oversight/corrections/` and PR #32 head `c140eb3d65e66c97846822788291a5dc2bed7155` (GitHub API: open/unmerged). All SHA-256 hashes below are over exact bytes.

| Case | Current canonical = PR #34 archived source | PR #32 correction history |
|---|---|---|
| `7750b56b775ed8959a` | 4,195 bytes, 3 rows, SHA-256 `a3d1236a98eb637afcd8d6822ff8e63c16dc4b4f70a407b83ef9ff76b9b29196`; byte-identical. | 5,634 bytes, 4 rows, SHA-256 `80d46bc660cf3bc51cf42c7ee469d54ca542b59a5c763da861fc6a6b7b2ad242`. The first three row timestamps align; `evidence_ref` differs at `1792738483` and `1792741896`; row `1792738485` matches; PR #32 adds a fourth confirmation row. |
| `edb67f8a646f569b5a` | 4,441 bytes, 3 rows, SHA-256 `bf7bf5fd3e7b04c6a0f8e12f82b189e7f67b519f38a324a5309cde8c0919ce20`; byte-identical. | 6,183 bytes, 4 rows, SHA-256 `79fa17e3351e215a4e1aa663752225c8cc1600fea09ed462f00061f3d952e28f`. The first three row timestamps align; `why_stronger` differs in each; PR #32 adds a fourth confirmation row. |

The PR #34 manifest correctly matches the two present canonical/archive byte lengths, hashes and row counts. Its per-timestamp `fields_different_from_incoming` maps also exactly match the row-by-row comparison with PR #32. Thus it preserves, byte-for-byte, the full contents of these two captured source files and makes their differences from PR #32 inspectable. It does not establish which alternate wording is correct, nor does it prove that no other transient evidence existed outside these two files.

## Authority and verification

The archived copies are in `records/oversight/source-evidence/2026-10-23/`, use `.source.txt` names, and are explicitly designated non-operative by their README and manifest. Act 17 §2 names `records/oversight/corrections/` as the authoritative Git-anchored trail; the audit-accountability implementation likewise resolves correction logs to that directory. PR #34 adds no file there, changes no verdict, and does not make an effective correction. It makes no change to `government/LAWS.md` or any other enacted text. I therefore find no factual indication that PR #34 itself creates an unjustified authoritative correction or changes law. This is not approval or merge authorization for PR #32, and does not adjudicate the merits of its correction wording.

On the exact PR #34 worktree/commit, `sh tests/records-smoke.sh` exited **0** with output:

```text
Viche: records carry no committed merge-conflict markers
```

No source canonical file, PR #32 file, outcome, or law was edited in this review.
