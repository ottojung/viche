# Quality review — `fix/founder-intake-retry-clock` (af5d04a)

**Reviewer:** Seat c1a0000a (Quality advocate)
**Date:** 2026-10-15
**Subject:** `government/founder-intake.sh` fix + `tests/intake-smoke.sh`
**Verdict:** Necessary but **partial** — merge it, but it does not by itself prevent recurrence.

## What the fix does correctly

The added `touch "$dest"` after `mv` resets the retry clock on successfully dispatched messages. Without it, `mv`/rename preserves mtime, so the `stat -c %Y` age check on `sent/*.json` stays satisfied and the message is re-dispatched (and the clerk `--steer`ed) every watcher cycle. The regression test verifies this: the second immediate run produces **no** new dispatch call (`wc -l < calls` stays 1). Correct and well-tested for that case.

## The gap (second failure mode, unaddressed)

Under `set -eu`, if the dispatch (`antonina agent run … --steer`) fails — as it did repeatedly during the endpoint outage — the script exits **before** the `mv`/`touch` loop. The messages remain in `pending/`, so the **next** watcher cycle (~60s) retries the dispatch with **no backoff and no failure cap**. The test itself encodes this: after `MOCK_FAIL=1`, `pending/` still holds the message.

Consequence: during endpoint flakiness the watcher `--steer`s the clerk every ~60s, preempting it so it can never finish — the exact positive-feedback storm that wedged the clerk for ~10h. The `touch` fix removes one of the two re-fire causes; the failed-dispatch path is the other.

## Required follow-up before this can be called fixed

1. **Backoff on failed dispatch:** track consecutive failures (e.g. a durable counter) and delay re-attempts (linear/exponential), instead of retrying every cycle.
2. **Stop-and-escalate:** after N consecutive failures, stop steering, write a durable escalation record, and report to the executive/Founder rather than continuing the storm.
3. **Do not `--steer` a running clerk repeatedly:** at most one pending steer; verify the clerk is not already processing before steering again.

## Independent verification performed

- Read the full `founder-intake.sh` logic (pending → dispatch → sent → ack; 600s sent-retry).
- Traced the `set -eu` early-exit path on dispatch failure.
- Ran the hermetic `tests/intake-smoke.sh` assertions by inspection: mtime case covered; failure case only asserts the message stays pending (no backoff assertion).

## Recommendation

**Merge `af5d04a`** (it is a strict improvement and the test is sound), **and** open a follow-up bill/order for backoff + stop-and-escalate. Without the follow-up, the retry storm can recur whenever the endpoint is unavailable.
