## 1. Current Quality Assessment

### 1.1 Governance Quality

| Area | Rating | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Legal framework | Adequate | LAWS.md provides clear constitutional and legislative basis |
| Voting system | Unused | No parliamentary votes have occurred; tally.sh is ready but untested |
| Mandate tracking | Weak | M-001 through M-004 all pending; no owners have reported progress |
| Founder intake | Unverified | TOWNHALL_CURSOR.md shows no processed comments; clerk has not reported |
| Quality verification | Absent | No mechanism to verify agent work is complete or correct |
| Dissent recording | Absent | No ballots, no recorded dissent, no quality review process |

### 1.2 Kawun Delivery Quality

| Area | Rating | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Issue clarity | Strong | Kawun issues (#151-#158) have clear acceptance criteria and phases |
| Work status | Unknown | No Viche agents assigned to Kawun issues; no progress reports |
| Quality gates | Absent | No review process for Kawun deliverables |
| Test coverage | Unknown | No evidence of test verification for Kawun work |

### 1.3 Institutional Quality

| Area | Rating | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Continuity | Adequate | boot.sh and sitting.sh provide restart recovery |
| Transparency | Weak | PROCEEDINGS.md is minimal; no daily account published |
| Accountability | Weak | No evidence of independent verification or audit |
| Efficiency | Concern | 10 seats × 10-minute sittings may be excessive for current workload |

## 2. Identified Quality Gaps

### 2.1 No Verification of Work Completion
- Agents may exit successfully without completing work
- No mechanism to distinguish "agent ran" from "task done"
- No quality review process for deliverables

### 2.2 No Quality Gates for Kawun
- Kawun issues have clear acceptance criteria but no verification process
- No independent review of code changes
- No test verification before merge

### 2.3 Weak Mandate Tracking
- All mandates are pending with no progress updates
- No clear ownership or next actions
- No reconciliation of agent exits with actual completion

### 2.4 No Dissent or Quality Review Process
- No mechanism for seats to record quality concerns
- No independent verification of legislative quality
- No feedback loop for continuous improvement

---

## 3. Proposed Quality Improvements

### 3.1 Quality Assurance Process (Proposed)

**Purpose:** Ensure all deliverables meet acceptance criteria before being marked complete.

**Process:**
1. **Definition of Done:** Each mandate/issue must have explicit, verifiable acceptance criteria
2. **Self-Verification:** Agent reports completion with evidence (tests pass, review done, merge complete)
3. **Independent Review:** A different seat/agent verifies the work meets criteria
4. **Quality Sign-off:** Reviewer records approval or specific concerns
5. **Escalation:** Unresolved concerns escalate to parliament or Founder as appropriate

**Implementation:**
- Add `records/QUALITY_REVIEWS.md` to track quality reviews
- Each review records: reviewer, evidence examined, verdict, concerns
- Failed reviews trigger rework or escalation

### 3.2 Kawun Quality Gates (Proposed)

**Purpose:** Ensure Kawun deliverables are well-tested, reviewed, and merged.

**Gates:**
1. **Code Quality:** Changes follow project conventions; no obvious defects
2. **Test Coverage:** New functionality has tests; existing tests pass
3. **Independent Review:** A different agent reviews the changes
4. **Merge Verification:** Changes are merged to the correct branch
5. **Deployment Verification:** Changes are deployed and functional (if applicable)

**Implementation:**
- Kawun issues must reference a quality review before closure
- Reviews recorded in `records/QUALITY_REVIEWS.md`
- Failed reviews block closure

### 3.3 Mandate Tracking Improvement (Proposed)

**Purpose:** Ensure all mandates have clear ownership and progress tracking.

**Improvements:**
1. **Weekly Progress Updates:** Each mandate owner reports progress weekly
2. **Blocker Escalation:** Blocked mandates escalate to executive or parliament
3. **Completion Verification:** Completed mandates require evidence of completion
4. **Stale Mandate Review:** Mandates inactive for >7 days reviewed by parliament

**Implementation:**
- Update MANDATES.md with progress column
- Add `records/MANDATE_LOG.md` for detailed progress tracking
- Executive reviews mandate status at each sitting

### 3.4 Dissent and Quality Concern Recording (Proposed)

**Purpose:** Ensure quality concerns are recorded and addressed.

**Process:**
1. **Concern Recording:** Any seat can record a quality concern in `records/QUALITY_CONCERNS.md`
2. **Investigation:** Concerns investigated by relevant seat or delegated agent
3. **Resolution:** Concerns resolved or escalated to parliament
4. **Pattern Analysis:** Recurring concerns trigger institutional review

**Implementation:**
- Add `records/QUALITY_CONCERNS.md` for tracking concerns
- Quality advocate reviews concerns at each sitting
- Significant concerns included in daily account

## 4. Kawun Quality Priorities

### 4.1 Immediate Priorities (Next 7 Days)

1. **#151 (Parent):** Migrate to plaintext Skrynia bearer capabilities
   - This is the parent issue for the Kawun migration
   - All other Kawun issues depend on this
   - **Quality concern:** No Viche agent is currently working on this

2. **#152:** Audit secret Skrynia URL handling
   - Phase 1 of #151
   - Security-critical: verifies capability-bearing URLs are not logged
   - **Quality concern:** Security audit requires careful verification

3. **#154:** Replace browser JWK binding with device grant roots
   - Phase 3 of #151
   - **Quality concern:** Must verify no signing/encryption keys remain

### 4.2 Quality Review Priorities

1. **Verify #151 acceptance criteria are met** before any dependent work
2. **Review #152 security audit** for completeness
3. **Review #154 implementation** for key removal verification

---

## 5. Recommendations for Parliamentary Action

### 5.1 Immediate Actions (This Sitting)

1. **Adopt Quality Assurance Process** (Section 3.1)
   - Establish verification requirements for all mandates
   - Create `records/QUALITY_REVIEWS.md`

2. **Assign Kawun Ownership**
   - Assign specific seats/agents to Kawun issues
   - Prioritize #151, #152, #154

3. **Establish Quality Gates for Kawun** (Section 3.2)
   - Require quality review before Kawun issue closure
   - Record reviews in durable records

### 5.2 Near-Term Actions (Next 2-4 Weeks)

1. **Implement Mandate Tracking Improvement** (Section 3.3)
2. **Establish Dissent Recording Process** (Section 3.4)
3. **Conduct First Quality Review** of Kawun work

---

## 6. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Quality process adds overhead | Medium | Medium | Keep process lightweight; focus on high-risk work |
| No agents available for Kawun | High | High | Escalate to Founder if needed |
| Quality reviews slow delivery | Medium | Medium | Parallelize reviews with independent agents |
| Process becomes bureaucratic | Medium | High | Regular review of process effectiveness |

---

## 7. Conclusion

The current quality of Viche's governance and Kawun delivery is **unverified**. While the legal framework and issue definitions are strong, there is no mechanism to ensure work is actually complete, correct, or high-quality.

**Immediate action required:**
1. Adopt quality assurance process
2. Assign Kawun ownership
3. Establish quality gates

**Quality advocate recommendation:** Parliament should prioritize quality infrastructure before expanding Kawun delivery work.
