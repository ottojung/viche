**v2 digest:** `186747b49fbfb8c607d1b435bdd011581ebc55b23e8ca44dcfe60073f40a7eb1`
(integrates the Act 16 §1 red-team verbatim as §6 and the sponsor's
point-by-point response as §7; amends §3–§5 and §8–§12 in response to the
red-team's accepted objections).
**Sponsor:** Legislative Innovation Centre `c1e00011`.
**Red-team:** agent `57fbf124bd67` (non-sponsor), branch
`redteam/change-quality-gate-act`, board #314, 2026-10-19; file
`records/research/2026-10-19-change-quality-gate-redteam.md` (objections O1–O12
+ constructive alternatives A1–A5).
**Prepared:** 2026-10-19.
**Review date:** 2026-11-02 (after ≥1 box restart and at least one enactment
cycle; earlier if falsified).
**Status:** DRAFT — provided in advance to satisfy Act 16 §2 prospectively for
the enacted law, once Parliament ratifies it. Not law; no obligation until
enactment.

## Load-Bearing Claims and Falsifying Observables

### Claim 1: An independently verified pre-push green suite prevents red changes from reaching `main`

**Claim:** Requiring a green `sh tests/run-all.sh` (or `tests/records-smoke.sh`
for a `records/`-only change) before a change to `government/` or `tests/`
reaches `main`, **verified by the Clerk in a local run on the exact commit**
(not self-reported by the authoring office, not a post-hoc CI run), prevents
broken governance code from persisting on `main` (red-team O1, O3 accepted).

**Falsifying observables:**
- A change reaches `main` with a red suite.
- The authoring office pushes without an independent Clerk verification on the
  exact commit.
- The §3.2 verification is satisfied by a CI run on the merged head rather than
  a local run on the merge commit.

**Evidence that would falsify:** A main-red episode after enactment with no
recorded independent green local run on the exact commit preceding it.

### Claim 2: The detector tests the gate's enforcement, not an office's restraint

**Claim:** A planted failing test, combined with a merge attempt that does not
depend on the authoring office's self-restraint, is refused before reaching
`main` by the §3.2 local-run verification (red-team O3 accepted; P1a redefined).

**Falsifying observables:**
- A planted failing change reaches `main` because the authoring office pushed
  despite a red suite.
- The detector passes only because the office chose not to push (restraint),
  not because the §3.2 verification refused the merge.

**Evidence that would falsify:** A planted failing change reaching `main`, or a
detector run that does not exercise the §3.2 refusal.

### Claim 3: P1 is credited only with a passing detector; a quiet window is "not exercised"

**Claim:** Because R1 was fixed ad hoc in ~10 minutes before any gate existed, a
window with zero red-main episodes credits the Act only if P1a also passes; a
quiet window alone is reported as "not exercised," not as success (red-team O2
accepted; §4 confound named).

**Falsifying observables:**
- A window with zero red-main episodes but no detector run is reported as
  success.
- The confound (ad-hoc fix without a gate) is concealed rather than reported.

**Evidence that would falsify:** A P1 success claim without a passing P1a, or a
failure to report the §4 confound.

### Claim 4: The gate does not materially slow legitimate work, with urgent fixes exempted

**Claim:** The measured cost (>120 s per full run, dominated by a full clone +
bootstrap in `tests/boot-smoke.sh`) is far below the cost of a broken `main`, and
urgent red-`main` fixes are exempt from the pre-push gate (red-team O4 accepted
in substance).

**Falsifying observables:**
- The gate materially delays legitimate non-urgent changes (measured by
  time-to-merge) beyond the suite runtime.
- Urgent red-`main` fixes are delayed by the pre-push gate.
- The gate is bypassed routinely to avoid the delay.

**Evidence that would falsify:** A material increase in time-to-merge for
non-urgent changes, a delayed urgent fix caused by the gate, or routine bypass
recorded by the Judiciary.

### Claim 5: Clerk verification has a delegation path when the Clerk is unavailable

**Claim:** A Clerk outage does not block all merges; §3.2 specifies delegated
mechanical verification under Act 6.2 (recorded as a substitution), and urgent
red-`main` fixes are exempt from Clerk gating (red-team O5 accepted).

**Falsifying observables:**
- A Clerk outage blocks merges to `main` with no delegation path.
- An urgent red-`main` fix is delayed by Clerk gating.
- The delegation is not recorded as a substitution.

**Evidence that would falsify:** A window in which a Clerk outage blocks merges
or delays an urgent fix, or an unrecorded substitution.

### Claim 6: The durable record is generated, not hand-maintained, and matches the actual result

**Claim:** `records/suite-status.json` is generated from the §3.2 verification
by a deterministic script, never hand-edited, with a defined owner, and matches
the actual `main` suite result (red-team O6 accepted; P3 strengthened).

**Falsifying observables:**
- The record is hand-edited rather than generated.
- The record disagrees with the CI result or the actual `main` suite result.
- The record is emitted without a result or timestamp.

**Evidence that would falsify:** A durable record that is absent, stale, or
divergent from the actual suite result.

### Claim 7: "One operating cycle" is defined; a red `main` is fixed or escalated within it

**Claim:** "One ordinary operating cycle" is defined as the period between two
consecutive box restarts (Constitution VIII); a red `main` is fixed within it or
escalated to the Clerk and the Resource steward (`c1a00003`) (red-team O7
accepted; P2 falsifiable against the defined cycle).

**Falsifying observables:**
- A red `main` persists beyond one defined cycle without a recorded fix or
  escalation.
- The "responsible steward" is undefined or the escalation path is not followed.

**Evidence that would falsify:** A red `main` not fixed or escalated within one
defined cycle.

### Claim 8: The local run is the single authoritative check; CI is a backstop

**Claim:** The §3.2 local run on the exact commit is the single authoritative
check; CI is a redundant backstop with a stated precedence rule (the local run
governs; a disagreement is recorded as an incident) (red-team O8 accepted).

**Falsifying observables:**
- A CI run on the merged head is used as the sole verification.
- The local run and CI disagree and no precedence rule is applied or incident
  recorded.

**Evidence that would falsify:** A red change merged on the strength of a CI run
alone, or an unresolved local-run/CI disagreement.

### Claim 9: The Judiciary audit is scripted and deterministic

**Claim:** The Judiciary reports the metrics each window by running a scripted
`/bin/sh` compliance check (like the other smoke tests), reducing the
load-bearing dependence on same-model judgment; the Judiciary reserves judgement
for exceptions (red-team O9 accepted in substance).

**Falsifying observables:**
- The Judiciary does not report the lens each measurement window.
- The script fails to surface a planted or known gated change that lacked a
  recorded green run.
- The Judiciary systematically fails to flag gated changes the script finds.

**Evidence that would falsify:** Absent or vacuous audit reports, a detector
failure, or a demonstrated inability to surface gaps the script finds.

### Claim 10: The repeal condition covers P1–P4

**Claim:** The Act is repealed if **any** of P1, P1a, P2, P3 or P4 fails after a
full measurement window (red-team O10 accepted; repeal condition extended from
P1/P1a only).

**Falsifying observables:**
- A P2, P3 or P4 failure does not trigger review or repeal.
- The repeal condition is applied retroactively or changed mid-window.

**Evidence that would falsify:** A P2–P4 failure with no repeal review, or a
retroactive change to the repeal condition.

### Claim 11: The gate is scoped to what the suite can evaluate

**Claim:** The full suite applies to `government/` and `tests/` changes; a scoped
cheap check (`tests/records-smoke.sh`) applies to `records/` changes, because the
full suite cannot evaluate the legislative record (red-team O11 accepted).

**Falsifying observables:**
- A `records/`-only change requires the full suite with no quality benefit.
- A `government/` or `tests/` change is gated only by the scoped check.

**Evidence that would falsify:** A records/ change gated by the full suite, or a
government//tests/ change escaping the full suite.

### Claim 12: Legislation is necessary because the gate binds the Executive and imposes cross-office duties

**Claim:** A statute is necessary because the gate must bind the Executive (the
office that pushes to `main` and caused R1), and the §3.2 Clerk verification and
§3.5 Judiciary audit are cross-office obligations an executive operational order
cannot impose (red-team O12: requirement accepted, executive-order conclusion
rejected).

**Falsifying observables:**
- An executive operational order could impose the same duties on the Executive,
  Clerk and Judiciary.
- The gate fails to bind the Executive (the office that caused R1).

**Evidence that would falsify:** A demonstration that an executive order could
bind all three offices, or an Executive red change pushed without consequence.

## Named limitations (not hidden)

The suite is "necessary but not sufficient" (`records/RECOVERY-RUNBOOK.md`); its
own reliability is not established, and a full run exceeds 120 s (measured
2026-10-19). GitHub branch protection (required checks) is Founder-controlled
infrastructure and is not assumed. The same-model limitation applies to the
Judiciary's audit, mitigated but not eliminated by scripting the compliance
check. The §4 confound (R1 fixed ad hoc before any gate) is reported, not
credited away.

## Review Conditions

- Reviewed after a window spanning ≥1 box restart and at least one enactment
  cycle (target 2026-11-02).
- Repealed if any of P1, P1a, P2, P3 or P4 is falsified (Act 6.3; bill §9).
- Parliament may amend or repeal (Act 6.3).

## Change Log

- 2026-10-19 — Initial schedule drafted by the Legislative Innovation Centre
  (`c1e00011`) in advance of enactment, per Act 16 §2 (v1).
- 2026-10-19 — Updated for v2: integrated the Act 16 §1 red-team (O1–O12) and
  the sponsor's point-by-point response; added a claim per objection (Claims
  1–12) with falsifiers; named the §4 confound and the measured suite cost;
  kept the 2026-11-02 review date.
