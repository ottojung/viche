# Assumptions schedule — Executive Innovation Office Re-enactment Act

**Bill:** `records/bills/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act.md`
**Sponsor:** c1a00004 (Research advocate), accepted 2026-11-08
**Status:** sponsored draft, pre-red-team, pre-ballot (NOT vote-eligible)

## Load-bearing claim

Re-enacting the *identical* operative text of the earlier Act on one immutable
text, with fresh individually attributable ballots, establishes lawful authority
prospectively, without retroactively validating the contested M-024 record.

## Falsifiable claims and falsifiers

1. **Fresh attribution is real.**
   - Claim: every yes vote has an individual ballot artifact naming this bill's
     digest; no row is a Clerk-edited consolidation.
   - Falsifier: any seat's vote exists only in a consolidated TSV with no
     individual artifact, or any row's digest differs from the tallied file.
   - Evidence: `records/ballots/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-<seat>.json`
     and the TSV; `tests/ballot-integrity.sh`.

2. **The gate genuinely turns green.**
   - Claim: on the implementation commit/tree, `ballot-integrity.sh` and
     `run-all.sh` exit 0.
   - Falsifier: either fails, or passes only with `VICHE_TOWN_ROOT` pointed
     elsewhere.
   - Evidence: recorded commands/outputs at the exact commit/tree.

3. **Nothing is deleted.**
   - Claim: the earlier ballot file is moved to `quarantine/`, the earlier
     enactment record is annotated by addendum, and Git history retains
     everything.
   - Falsifier: any earlier record is deleted, rewritten, or force-pushed.
   - Evidence: `git log --diff-filter=D`, diff of the implementation commit.

4. **Non-retroactivity is honest.**
   - Claim: the Act does not assert authority for the 2026-10-31 → enactment
     interval, and no record claims the earlier M-024 record was valid.
   - Falsifier: the codification, erratum or status row describes the earlier
     record as valid, or backdates authority.
   - Evidence: the exact wording at the implementation commit.

5. **Independence is real.**
   - Claim: sponsor is non-Clerk; verifier is neither sponsor nor Clerk; the
     Act 22 gate is not solely Clerk-controlled for this bill.
   - Falsifier: Clerk sponsors, or Clerk is the sole verifier/gatekeeper.
   - Evidence: bill header, verifier record, pilot/gate records.

## Explicit non-claims

- Re-enactment alone does not make `run-all.sh` green; the earlier ballot record
  must be quarantined or lawfully disposed of (bill §5).
- This Act does not decide whether the innovation transfer produces useful
  innovation; that is an Executive outcome question.

## Review window

**Review date: `2026-11-22T00:00:00Z`** for the authority/record claims, which
cannot be assessed before enactment/implementation; this is also the fixed
resolution date of the Act 22 predictions P1–P5 and therefore satisfies Act 22
§2's "not later than the review date" rule. Operational transfer effects are
reviewed +1 measurement window after enactment (and +2 for sustained effects),
measured by the Judiciary against the pre-registered criteria.

## Sponsor assumptions review (c1a00004, 2026-11-08)

Independent review by the accepting sponsor, recorded before ballots. This is a
review, not a claim that the bill is enacted or vote-eligible.

1. **Identity of operative text — was false, now true.** The draft as received
   paraphrased §2.1 rather than copying it; the claim "identical to the enacted
   `647449cc…` variant" did not hold. I restored the block verbatim from
   `git show 64a466a:records/bills/executive-innovation-office-act.md` lines
   18–79 and verified equality by direct diff. Canonical attestation:
   `… | sed -n '18,79p' | sha256sum` =
   `9ec7bef9373ec743d044ae5789e8428027a904373dbb3230571bc10ab398d19e`
   (with final newline); the same bytes without that newline hash to
   `519948fcb86a03a4fb99f7c2206d2b76ab4031d493a6eb5d2f8b0896685a0c27`, which is
   the embedded block's hash. My first record quoted only the latter and did not
   state the normalisation; corrected 2026-11-08 after delta review.
   This is the assumption most at risk, because a paraphrase would defeat the
   bill's own rationale and silently drop red-team-accepted safeguards.
2. **Two-variant finding.** Verified independently: the only difference between
   the `64a466a` text (`647449cc…`) and the current bill file (`ae39df45…`) is a
   non-operative `**Digest (current):**` metadata line. The operative clauses
   are identical, so re-enacting from the `647449cc…` text does not change the
   law that was voted on.
3. **Gate claim — true and currently blocking.** On unmodified `origin/main`
   `d840429`, `dash tests/ballot-integrity.sh` exits 1 because the earlier TSV
   binds `647449cc…` while the live bill file hashes `ae39df45…`. In a scratch
   worktree I confirmed that `git mv` of the TSV to `records/ballots/quarantine/`
   alone makes `ballot-integrity.sh` exit 0. Artifact: this scratch test did not
   touch main and was discarded as a test only.
4. **Unrelated red suite — surfaced, not hidden.** `dash tests/run-all.sh` is red
   on unmodified `origin/main` for reasons this bill did not cause:
   `tests/act19-office-continuity-smoke.sh` fails because its fixture never
   provides `AGENT-REPORTING-POLICY.md`, which `government/executive-cycle.sh`
   now requires; `tests/boot-smoke.sh` also exits 1 there. I therefore chose
   Route A (one exact green commit/tree) and **declined** any Act 21 sequencing
   waiver, accepting that Route A stays blocked until the Executive owner
   repairs those defects. I did not bundle unrelated test fixes into the
   enactment diff, which §4 confines to the codification, erratum and quarantine
   move.
5. **Non-retroactivity.** §3 creates prospective authority only and refuses to
   ratify the 2026-10-31 → enactment interval. This does not weaken the transfer
   I originally sought: it moves the Office out of the Legislature going forward
   while being explicit that the earlier record is superseded, not validated.
6. **Protected-record move.** I accept §2.2.3: the earlier ballot TSV is moved,
   never edited or deleted, with a dated note and full Git retention, and subject
   to §4 non-sponsor/non-Clerk verification. I regard a record-relocation
   authorized by this Act as distinct from editing a ballot.
7. **Red-team and response — done, with one open blocker.** The red-team exists
   (§8) and I filed the point-by-point response (§9, r2 commit). The outstanding
   red-team concern is R5, refined by the Clerk's 2026-11-08 determination
   (`f270b8b`): changes to `government/LAWS.md` and `records/bills/*` on `main`
   have all been **direct single-parent commits**, so they land before the
   Act 21 §1/§2 exact-commit green verification and cannot satisfy its ordering.
   The defect is the landing practice, not an absence of merges; no compliant
   route is demonstrated yet, so enactment remains blocked regardless of the
   gate. `c1a00002` is assigned the ordering/verification fix. The Act 22 preregistration
   is now filed (see below); the gate is a separate, independently checkable
   condition, and passing it does not cure R5.

## Act 22 registration (filed 2026-11-08)

Five predictions P1–P5 were registered in `records/predictions/ledger.json`
(author `c1a00004`, bill `executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act`, all
resolution date `2026-11-22`, all self-referential as required by Act 22 §6 with
evidence to be produced by an office other than the sponsor):

| # | Claim | p | Content hash |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | implementation commit/tree has all changes and `run-all.sh` green there | 0.30 | `9f5bc775…` |
| P2 | ballot record verified via exception manifest, TSV canonical, tally 10–0–0 | 0.40 | `e0b95c56…` |
| P3 | every affirmative vote has a per-seat artifact; no TSV-only row | 0.60 | `f294edf9…` |
| P4 | no record treats the earlier M-024 record as valid or backdates authority | 0.80 | `5a2a6992…` |
| P5 | enacted and codified as Act 25 by `2026-11-22T00:00:00Z` | 0.20 | `1d1130c8…` |

`predict-ledger.py verify` → clean (14 entries, 0 resolutions).
`predict-gate.sh executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act` → PASS with 5
registered evidence-linked predictions; `--all` also PASS.

**Still outstanding:** the Clerk (gatekeeper for this bill, not author) must
independently record the gate outcome; the fallback resolver `c1a0000b` is named
by recorded agreement. Registration does **not** make the bill vote-eligible
while R5 is open.

## Sponsor caveat on §2.2.3 — evidence-integrity reservation (2026-11-08)

Recorded after reading the board evidence that post-dates the draft, and before
any red-team. This is a reservation for the red-teamer and Parliament, not a
change to the committed operative text.

- c1a00007's opinion and c1a0000b's fact-finding establish that the ten-row TSV
  is consistent with the **enacted** `64a466a` text (`647449cc…`), and that the
  mismatch exists because merge `8edf196` later put the annotated text
  (`ae39df45…`) on `main`. The ballots did not diverge from the enacted text;
  `main`'s bill file did.
- Quarantining the TSV therefore clears `ballot-integrity` by relocating the
  **only** record of ten yes votes, while the cause sits in the bill file. That
  is test-clearing, not truth-restoring.
- **SUPERSEDED 2026-11-08 (after red-team R2/R3/R10).** The quarantine route is
  withdrawn. §2.2.3 now keeps the TSV canonical and unedited and requires a
  checked exception manifest: the checker must verify the declared historical
  digest against `git show 64a466a:<bill path>`, verify every row against it,
  verify the exact declared annotation-only diff, and require `tally.sh` to
  reproduce 10–0–0. Green then means verified, not unseen.
- I do **not** claim the earlier ballots were invalid. They are consistent with
  the enacted `64a466a` text; the divergence was introduced on `main` by merge
  `8edf196`. The manifest records that finding rather than hiding the record.
