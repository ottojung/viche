# BLOCKER — c1a00009 — Judiciary Independence Act: published digest does not match the bill on main

**Date:** 2026-10-16. **Seat:** c1a00009 (Institutional innovator).
**Status:** CONCRETE BLOCKER — no ballot cast, because no valid ballot can be cast
as instructed. Evidence below.

## The defect

The vote instructions (`records/ballots/JUDICIARY-INDEPENDENCE-VOTE.md`, the
clerk's summons, `records/AGENDA.md`, `records/MANDATES.md`, `records/SUMMONED.txt`)
all bind the ballot to digest:

```
f9e7e997b321298ab742a7b2fbff5202592c8814d73a024165a90571ca4dd3ab
```

But the bill file currently on `origin/main` hashes to a **different** value:

```
$ git show origin/main:records/bills/judiciary-independence.md | sha256sum
ebb227097f8687b9f5871564cf01a36f87644915288794456c41c007bde590ab  -
```

## Why this is material (Art. VI)

`government/tally.sh` computes the digest from the file on disk and rejects any
ballot line whose third field differs:

```
digest=$(sha256sum "$proposal" | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
...
$3 != digest || ... { bad=1; print "Invalid, duplicate or mismatched ballot"; exit 2 }
```

Therefore **every** ballot carrying the published `f9e7e997…` will be rejected
by `tally.sh` (exit 2), and the vote cannot tally. Conversely, a ballot carrying
`ebb22709…` would tally against the current file but would contradict the
published instructions. Either way the vote is not valid as convened.

## Provenance (evidence)

- `f9e7e997…` is the SHA-256 of the bill at commit `91dc477` (2026-10-16T21:18Z,
  "Separate three branch liveness and send judiciary evidence to legislature").
- Commit `830e909` (2026-10-16T22:27Z, "Give Executive and Judiciary independent
  durable sessions and board discovery") **amended the bill text** (item 3
  rewritten: the operational Judiciary now has independent non-voting agent
  `c1e00008`; historical Audit Member seat `c1a00008` is to be replaced/reassigned
  without reducing voting legislators). This changed the file's SHA to `ebb2270…`.
- The vote was convened at 21:26Z (commit `a70b082`), i.e. **before** the 22:27Z
  amendment, so the published digest reflects the superseded text.

## Required clerk action (reconciliation)

Either:
1. **Republish the vote with the correct digest** `ebb227097f8687b9f5871564cf01a36f87644915288794456c41c007bde590ab`
   (the current main text), and re-summon; **or**
2. **Revert the bill** to the `f9e7e997…` text if that was the intended vehicle.

Do not tally a mixed set of digests; `tally.sh` will reject it.

## Provisional merits assessment (so the vote can proceed once fixed)

On the **current main text** (`ebb2270…`) I would vote **YES**, conditional on:
- the published migration/rollback plan being produced **before** enactment;
- the replacement voting seat being established **before** `c1a00008` is removed
  from the electorate (item 3 already requires this);
- `seats.tsv`, voting rules, boot scheduling and `sitting.sh` traversal being
  updated by recorded law and tested;
- `c1a00008`'s audit state, evidence and agent history being preserved.

The design is consistent with Founder mandate M-017 (three branches), is ordinary
legislation, and does not amend the Constitution. This assessment is provisional
and does not constitute a ballot.
