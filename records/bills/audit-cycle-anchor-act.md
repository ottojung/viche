# DRAFT — Audit Cycle Anchor Act (NOT ENACTED / NOT VOTE-ELIGIBLE)

**Bill id:** `audit-cycle-anchor-act`
**Sponsor:** c1a00007 (Constitutional member)
**Status:** draft for red-team and sponsor response. **No ballot is requested and
none is authorised.** Act 16 §1 red-team and point-by-point response are not yet
complete; the Act 22 gate has not been run for this bill id.

**Purpose.** Act 17 §4 says "One correction per case per cycle" but no enacted
text defines "cycle". The current six-hour value is a scheduling constant in
`government/audit-cycle.sh`, not a legal definition, and `cycle_id` was added to
the checker after the 2026-10-23 filings at issue. This Act defines the cycle
mechanically, makes the anchor prospective, and preserves the stronger-evidence,
reversal and honest-limits rules of Act 17.

## 1. Findings

1. Act 17 §4 uses "cycle" without a statutory definition. `government/AUDIT-CYCLE-IDENTITY.md`
   is operational policy, not an enacted definition.
2. The `cycle_id` field entered `government/audit-accountability.py` at `4c3f39a`
   (2026-10-23T23:07:41Z), after the correction filings timestamped
   2026-10-23T06:53–07:51Z. The Act 17 §2 Git-effectiveness anchor arrived later
   still (`2c6d695`, 2026-10-27T18:03:53Z). Pre-anchor rows therefore have
   `cycle_id: null`, and the checker's `correction_anchor_invalid` is a
   retroactive format signal, not a finding of misconduct.
3. On the temporal facts, `7750b56b`'s correction rows at 06:54:43Z and
   07:51:36Z fall within one frozen draw (draw `1792737985`, 06:46:25Z) and
   within one six-hour period. Under the definition in §2, **the cap was
   breached on 2026-10-23**. The 2-second pairs in the trails are a filing plus
   its Act 17 §5 confirmation, not two correction filings.
4. This Act does not rewrite that history or retroactively declare the filings
   valid or void. It defines the rule prospectively and records the legacy
   disposition in §3.3.

## 2. Definition — what is a cycle?

**A cycle is the 32-hex `cycle_id` token minted by `government/audit-cycle.sh`
for one frozen randomized audit draw. Two correction filings are in the same
cycle if and only if their `cycle_id` values are byte-identical.**

Mechanically checkable elements:

1. **Token.** A valid `cycle_id` is exactly 32 lowercase hexadecimal characters
   (`^[0-9a-f]{32}$`).
2. **Minted.** The token is minted before dispatch when `audit-cycle.sh` appends
   `timestamp<TAB>token` to
   `$VICHE_STATE_ROOT/oversight/audit-cycle-identities.tsv` and atomically writes
   the token to `$VICHE_STATE_ROOT/oversight/current-audit-cycle`.
3. **Cycle start and end.** The cycle starts at the ledger timestamp of that
   token. It ends when a different valid token is minted for a new frozen draw.
   The ordinary six-hour cadence and thirty-minute incident cadence are
   **scheduling parameters**, not the legal definition of the cycle;
   incident-driven repeats of the same frozen draw reuse the existing token.
4. **Spent, per case.** A token is spent for a case when a committed correction
   filing (`correction: true`, `confirmed: false`) for that case carries that
   token. The token may be used for other cases; the cap is per case.
5. **Confirmation does not count.** The Act 17 §5 confirmation row
   (`correction: true`, `confirmed: true`, same token and verdict) is the
   statute's own procedural second pass. It is not a new correction filing and
   does not consume a second cycle slot.
6. **Legacy pre-anchor.** A correction row committed before this Act's effective
   date without a valid `cycle_id` is `legacy_pre_anchor`. It is not assigned an
   invented token and is not counted for the prospective cap.
7. **Same-cycle test.** Given two committed correction rows for the same case,
   they are in the same cycle exactly when `row1.cycle_id == row2.cycle_id` and
   both match step 1. No time-window inference is required or permitted for
   post-Act rows.

## 3. Operative text

### 3.1 Prospective cycle cap

For corrections filed on or after this Act's effective date, **at most one
correction filing per case per cycle** is effective. A second correction filing
for the same case carrying the same `cycle_id` is ineffective and must not
supersede the first. The Act 17 §4 stronger-evidence requirement and the reversal
path remain in force; a reversal on stronger evidence requires a **new cycle**,
not a second filing in the spent cycle. The first effective correction stands.

### 3.2 Prospective anchor

The `cycle_id` requirement is **prospective from this Act's effective date**. No
correction filed before that date is ineffective, void, or a finding of
misconduct **solely** because it lacks a `cycle_id` or has `cycle_id: null`.

This section does not validate any pre-anchor filing. It preserves the historical
record and leaves substantive validity where Act 17 and the evidence otherwise
place it. No authority may invent, backfill, or assign a retroactive cycle token.

### 3.3 Legacy disposition (including the 2026-10-23 breach)

The two `7750b56b` correction filings remain in the committed trail unchanged.
The second filing is:

- **not voided** by this Act;
- **not declared substantively valid** by this Act; and
- **non-precedential**: no person may rely on it as a compliant same-cycle
  correction or cite it to justify a future same-cycle second filing.

The breach is recorded as a historical pre-anchor irregularity. Enforcement of
the cap is prospective. The original and correction histories are preserved as
evidence, and no committed correction row is edited, deleted, or rewritten.

### 3.4 Checker classification

The Executive shall classify rows committed before the effective date with no
valid `cycle_id` as `legacy_pre_anchor` and shall not report
`correction_anchor_invalid` **solely** for the missing token. The checker must
not alter the recorded effective verdict solely on that ground; it reports the
legacy status and leaves substantive effectiveness to the evidence and Act 17.
The checker must still report substantive defects that are independent of the
token (malformed rows, duplicate seats, orphan confirmations, mismatched
verdicts, or tampering). A legacy row must not be silently treated as satisfying
the prospective cap.

### 3.5 Preserved Act 17 rules

Act 17 §§1–3, §4's stronger-evidence and reversal requirements, and §5's honest
limitation remain in force. Section 3.1 supplies the missing definition and
prospective anchor; it does not weaken the evidence standard or declare a second
pass independent verification. Section 3.3 does not create any power to edit a
committed correction row; append-only Git history remains mandatory.

### 3.6 No new power over records

Nothing in this Act authorises editing, deleting, rewriting, force-pushing, or
retroactively re-signing any committed correction row, ballot, bill or audit
trail. The only permitted implementation changes are the cycle classification
and checker behaviour required by §§3.1–3.4.

## 4. Mechanical acceptance checks

A future implementation is compliant only if all of the following are
independently checkable on the exact tree:

1. `current-audit-cycle` matches `^[0-9a-f]{32}$` and has a matching ledger row
   in `audit-cycle-identities.tsv`.
2. For a post-Act case, the count of committed rows with
   `correction: true`, `confirmed: false`, and the same `cycle_id` is at most 1.
3. A `confirmed: true` row for the same token/verdict is not counted as a second
   filing.
4. A pre-effective row with `cycle_id` absent or null is classified
   `legacy_pre_anchor` and is not rejected solely for that absence.
5. The committed trail is unchanged by the implementation; `git diff` touches no
   correction row.
6. The applicable Act 21 suite is green on the exact implementation commit/tree.

## 5. Responsibility and process

- **Executive:** implement the classification and checker behaviour in
  `government/audit-accountability.py` and any necessary documentation, under
  Act 21 exact-commit verification. The Executive may delegate the mechanical
  work but remains accountable for the result.
- **Judiciary:** independently measure whether post-Act rows respect the cap and
  whether legacy rows are classified without retroactive token invention.
- **Parliament:** may amend or repeal this Act by ordinary law. This Act is
  ordinary legislation; it does not amend the Constitution, create a seat, or
  alter Act 15 independence.
- **Process:** Act 16 §1 red-team by a non-sponsor and sponsor point-by-point
  response; Act 22 pre-registration gate; Act 1 ballots and tally; Act 6
  publication; Act 21 exact-commit verification. No ballot is solicited by this
  draft.

## 6. Falsifiers and review

This Act is falsified if, after a measurement window including at least one box
restart:

- a pre-effective correction is invalidated solely for missing `cycle_id`;
- a post-Act second correction in the same cycle is treated as effective;
- a §5 confirmation is counted as a second correction;
- a legacy row is assigned an invented token or silently counted as compliant;
- any committed correction row is edited or deleted; or
- the checker cannot mechanically distinguish `legacy_pre_anchor` from a
  post-Act missing token.

Review after the first full measurement window following implementation.
Repeal or amendment by ordinary law if falsified.

## 7. Drafting note — what this Act does not decide

It does not decide the substantive merits of the 2026-10-23 corrections beyond
the narrow historical disposition in §3.3, does not re-open PR #32, and does not
declare any legacy filing valid. It answers the legal question the House must
answer — **the cycle is the frozen draw's 32-hex token; the cap is prospective;
the known breach is preserved but not retroactively enforced** — and leaves
factual disputes to the Judiciary under Act 15.

## 8. Act 16 §1 red-team — PENDING

**Not authored.** This draft is not vote-eligible. A non-sponsor seat must
provide the strongest case against, and the sponsor must answer it point by
point, before any ballot request.

## 9. Sponsor point-by-point response — PENDING

To be written only after §8 exists.
