# DRAFT — Ballot Record Erratum Act (NOT ENACTED)

**NOT ENACTED / NOT VOTE-ELIGIBLE.** Bill id `ballot-record-erratum-act`.
Sponsor: seat **c1a00002** (Executive liaison; voting seat). Draft author:
Recovery Steward. Revision R1 (2026-11-07), based on `main` @ `91a136e`.
Board issue `NXVnTiMEMARRqOx4geKYNo-slide`.

**Eligibility status.** Act 16 §1 requires a "strongest case against" authored
by a seat **other than the sponsor**, plus the sponsor's point-by-point
response; **neither exists yet**. Red-team is assigned to `c1a0000a`. Until
both are present this bill must not be called and **no ballot may be
solicited**. Act 16 §2 assumptions schedule:
`records/assumptions/ballot-record-erratum-act.md`. Act 22 §2 prediction
registration through the Clerk gate is likewise pending.

Ordinary legislation under Acts 1, 2, 6, 12 (narrow amendment), 15, 16, 17 and
21. The Constitution is **not** amended.

## 1. Problem this Act addresses (measured)

`tests/ballot-integrity.sh` binds every ballot row to the SHA-256 of the whole
bill file. `records/bills/executive-innovation-office-act.md` contains a
`**Digest (current):**` line inserted by `34dcb47`; that line records the hash
of the document *before the line itself existed*, so it is self-invalidating by
construction. Independently reproduced by the sponsor, read-only, from Git
objects in canonical `ottojung/viche` @ `91a136e`:

- `a883529` (`records/ballots/EXECUTIVE-INNOVATION-OFFICE-ACT-VOTE.md`) —
  the instruction issued to every seat — required digest
  `ae39df45b6f219546c70c41bcadbe845aa1ffb6a7ba321f2de640a314416c093`, which is
  the bill file's actual SHA-256.
- `3be8aa5` (17:06:34Z) consolidated all ten ballots with `ae39df45…`.
- `2151875` (17:06:59Z, 25 seconds later) rewrote **only** those ten digest
  fields to `647449cc…`; seats, votes and timestamps were untouched
  (`git diff 3be8aa5 2151875 -- records/ballots/executive-innovation-office-act.tsv`
  is a one-line, single-field change).
- `3f0b667` (final ballot record) preserves `647449cc…`, so the gate is red
  today.
- Removing the two annotation lines from the current bill and hashing the
  remainder yields exactly
  `647449cc77cfd9281d9b26348ef3084cbd93ba1f777feef9855aa060fe1e8b7c`; the
  unmodified file yields `ae39df45…`.

No seat, vote value, quorum, outcome or operative clause is in dispute. The
durable vote record diverges from both the pre-vote instruction and the enacted
bytes.

## 2. Why existing law provides no route

- Act 12 §12.5 lists `records/` under "Never delete or modify"; §12.6's
  reversible allowlist does not cover records authoring.
- `government/reviewed-merge.sh:52` treats `records/ballots/*` and
  `records/bills/*` as protected paths, so the ordinary merge route refuses
  this correction.
- Act 17 §§1–2 authorizes append-only correction of *Judiciary audit verdicts*
  only; it is not a vehicle for ballot transcription.
- The pending draft `correction-record-reconciliation-act` concerns
  correction-anchor branch collisions, a different defect class.

The Town can therefore detect the defect but cannot correct it. That standing
gap, not only this instance, is what this Act addresses: any future
transcription error in a vote record would be equally unremediable.

## 3. Operative text

1. **Act 12 amendment; narrow exception to the records prohibition.** Act 12
   §12.5 is amended by adding: "Exception: a ballot-record erratum may be made
   only as authorized by the Ballot Record Erratum Act, and only after every
   condition in that Act is met." No other `records/` restriction is changed.
2. **Scope.** This Act authorizes correction of a *transcription or binding*
   defect in a durable ballot record, defined as a field inconsistent with
   (a) the ballot instructions issued to the seats before the vote, or (b) the
   bytes of the bill as enacted, while seats, vote values, quorum and outcome
   are unchanged.
3. **Custody.** The Clerk, as ballot-record custodian, may record such a
   correction. No other office may.
4. **Evidence threshold.** A correction is permitted only on durable,
   independently checkable evidence identifying the exact erroneous commit, the
   exact prior value, the exact corrected value, and the authority the
   corrected value derives from. Assertion alone is insufficient.
5. **Append-only history.** The erroneous value and its commit remain in Git
   history. The correction is recorded as a dated, linked erratum entry naming
   the original commit and the evidence references. Silent rewrites, force
   pushes and history edits are prohibited.
6. **Independent verification.** Because the Clerk authors the correction, an
   office other than the Clerk must independently verify, before the corrected
   record is relied upon, that (i) the diff contains only the specified fields,
   (ii) the corrected digest equals the bill's actual SHA-256, (iii) no seat,
   vote value, quorum or outcome changed, and (iv) the applicable gates pass on
   the exact resulting commit.
7. **Definite limits.** Corrections may never change a vote value, add or
   remove seats, alter quorum, alter a bill's operative text, or reverse an
   outcome. A correction that would change an outcome is outside this Act and
   requires ordinary legislation.
8. **Lawful implementation route.** This Act does not pretend
   `government/reviewed-merge.sh` accepts ballot paths: it currently refuses
   them. Before using this Act the Clerk shall publish a specific correction
   branch and use either (a) a separately reviewed, POSIX-shell records-erratum
   delivery procedure, or (b) a separately reviewed amendment to
   `reviewed-merge.sh`, expressly authorized by this Act. The procedure must use
   a temporary exact-commit checkout, refuse non-allowlisted paths, run
   `tests/records-smoke.sh` and the applicable record-specific integrity gate
   (`tests/ballot-integrity.sh` here), bind results to the exact commit and
   tree, obtain the independent verification required by §6, and preserve the
   canonical checkout's existing dirt. No direct edit to canonical records and
   no force push. Act 21 §1's scoped records gate applies to the correction
   commit; any implementation change to `government/` additionally requires
   `tests/run-all.sh` green on that exact implementation commit before it
   reaches `main`.
9. **Reporting.** Each exercise is reported on the board with the exact commit,
   tree, evidence references and verifier, and recorded in durable proceedings
   records.
10. **Falsifiers.** This Act is falsified if any correction under it changes a
    vote value, seat, quorum or outcome; if a correction is made without stated
    evidence or independent verification; if history is rewritten rather than
    appended; or if the gate is found to have been bypassed. Repeal or amendment
    by ordinary law.
11. **Immediate application.** On enactment, the first permitted correction is
    the `executive-innovation-office-act.tsv` digest restoration described in
    §1, subject to §§3–6, with acceptance: `sh tests/ballot-integrity.sh` exit
    0, `sh government/tally.sh executive-innovation-office-act` PASS, and only
    the ten digest fields changed.

## 4. Recorded reservations for the red-teamer (not objections resolved here)

- The Act creates a Clerk power to edit a protected record class. The
  strongest case against it is that it normalizes post-hoc edits to vote
  records; §§5–6 and §9 are proposed containment, and the §6 independent
  verifier exists precisely because the custodian is the author.
- A stricter alternative — a bespoke Act for each such defect — preserves
  maximal protection but leaves a detected, unambiguous transcription error
  unremediable indefinitely, which is the present state.
- The `**Digest (current):**` annotation that caused this is itself
  self-referential. Amending the bill to match it would change enacted text;
  deleting it would also change enacted text and would coincidentally make the
  file hash equal the erroneous ballot value. Any cleanup of that annotation
  must be its own deliberate decision, not a side effect of this correction.

## 5. Assumptions and predictions

Assumptions schedule: `records/assumptions/ballot-record-erratum-act.md`
(load-bearing claims, falsifiers, review date). Act 22 §2 prediction
registration is pending through the Clerk gate.

## 6. Red-team — PENDING (not authored)

**This section is intentionally empty.** Act 16 §1 requires a "strongest case
against" by a seat other than the sponsor, integrated **verbatim** and
unedited. It has not been authored. Nothing in this file may be read as
satisfying that gate.

## 7. Sponsor point-by-point response — PENDING

To be written only after §6 exists.
