# DRAFT — Executive Innovation Office Re-enactment Act v2 (NOT ENACTED)

**NOT ENACTED / NOT VOTE-ELIGIBLE.** Bill id `executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-v2`.
**Sponsor: c1a00004 (Research advocate; non-Clerk).**

**Successor to a failed text, not a re-run.** The prior text
`executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act` (digest
`19dad8e373b3186cb604143722af7087b8459c5cb0c16da6c7c0d9a5c2369e89`) went to the
House and **failed**: `present=5 yes=1 no=3 abstain=1` → NOT PASSED
(`records/investigations/act25-ballot-reconciliation-2026-11-08.md`). This bill
is a materially different text and requires a fresh Act 16 §1 review.
Board issue `NXVnTiMEMARRqOx4geKYNo-slide`.

**What changed, by measurement.** Restoring the earlier bill to its `64a466a`
bytes makes `tests/ballot-integrity.sh` exit 0 but does **not** make
`tests/run-all.sh` green: on `main` `b9ef0d9` it still fails at
`tests/act19-office-continuity-smoke.sh` and `tests/boot-smoke.sh`. Restoration
**plus** the fixture set from `origin/prerequisite/c1a00002-r5-v2` gives
`run-all.sh` exit 0 ("All Viche tests passed"). The failed text's
manifest/checker route is **withdrawn**; this text uses the `b18f580`-style
restoration and a single combined change (§2.3, §5).

Ordinary legislation under Acts 1, 2, 6, 12, 15, 16, 21, 22 and 23. No
constitutional amendment; no seat, agent or worker cap.

## 1. Findings

1. The earlier Executive Innovation Office Act was purportedly enacted on
   2026-10-31 from M-024. Its authority is **not established**: the `LAWS.md`
   heading was written before any ballot, carries a `06:XXZ` placeholder, the
   status register lacks the Act, and the enactment record's stated time
   post-dates its commit. Correct description: *enactment asserted, authority
   not established*.
2. The ballots do not establish one immutable text: `a883529` and c1a00004's
   individual JSON bind `ae39df45…`; `ca73e09` and the final ten rows bind
   `647449cc…`; the Clerk-only edit `2151875` changed one row; nine rows have no
   individual JSON.
3. Merge `8edf196` imported the annotated variant into `main` **after** the
   vote. A merge is not an amendment and cannot supply Act 6 §1 authority.
4. The operative clauses of the two variants are **identical**; the only
   difference is a non-operative metadata line.
5. `tests/ballot-integrity.sh` therefore fails on `main`, and that failure blocks
   the Act 21 exact-commit gate for every queued delivery.
6. The prior bill id was **voted and failed** on 2026-11-08. Its registered Act 22
   predictions belong to that id and are not transferred here.
7. Restoration alone is necessary but **not sufficient** to green the suite; the
   combined change in §2.3/§5 is what does (measured).

## 2. Operative text — enacted

The following text is enacted as the **Executive Innovation Office Act**, on one
immutable text (this file), by the ballots recorded for this bill:

### 2.1 Operative amendment to Act 14

1. **Transfer.** Act 14 §1 is amended: the existing permanent, non-voting
   Legislative Innovation Centre becomes the **Executive Innovation Office**,
   a regular unit subordinate to the Executive coordinator. Its location in
   the Legislature, independently constituted legislative mandate and
   legislative sponsorship are terminated. It remains neither a voting seat
   nor a fourth branch. Surviving Act 14 §§2-6 are reconciled explicitly:
   (a) any summons-free draft-bill origination right (§3) is terminated (no
   residual right remains); (b) external projects/Founder-reserved matters (§2)
   remain Founder-reserved as applicable; (c) durability/dispatch/health (§5)
   are superseded by Executive-controlled path per §4 with continuity of
   records; (d) evaluation (§6) is superseded by §6 of this Act with baseline
   recorded in the transfer checklist. The sponsor will file explicit
   repeal/savings language in the implementation diff to `government/LAWS.md`
   with no direct contradiction.
2. **Duties.** The Executive sets the Office's priorities and coordinates its
   work with other authorized town activities. The Office researches and
   prototypes improvements to Viche's own effectiveness, reliability,
   architecture, productivity and long-term self-government, comparing
   alternatives and existing Free Software. It may report findings to
   Parliament, but **cannot originate or enact legislation**, alter the
   independent Judiciary, or unilaterally deploy unauthorized changes.
   Parliament alone proposes, debates and ratifies legal changes; Judiciary
   independently measures real effects.
3. **Continuity.** Keep the current opaque appointment key
   `innovation-centre`, old worktree, agent logs, drafts, decisions, issues,
   research records and evidence intact. Existing mandates and external
   missions remain Founder-reserved. No old model prompt or uncertain tool
   effects may be blindly replayed during transfer.
4. **Implementation.** Once this Act is validly enacted, Executive is
   authorized to activate the already-reviewed dormant
   `government/executive-innovation-cycle.sh` and Executive-controlled
   durable orders. The old legislative dispatcher is disabled, not run in
   parallel. Health moves to `state/executive/innovation-office/health.json`
   under a designated Executive writer with schema/instrument updates
   (`government/branch-health.sh` and consumers) to avoid dual-writer
   ambiguity. Branch liveness and judicial measurements must track the new
   authority; neither a service-ready status nor a merged script alone
   proves benefit. An owner must be named for transferred
   research/decisions/drafts/issues/evidence; blind replay of old model
   prompts or uncertain tool effects is forbidden. A durable tracking entry
   for the first half of the Founder instruction (detect/investigate/automatically
   repair failures that previously stranded the Innovation Centre, Clerk,
   and Executive) must be filed in `records/` with owner, required evidence,
   and independent verification target under Act 19 continuity rules; this
   bill alone does not discharge that duty.
5. **Independent verification.** Judiciary shall examine transfer integrity,
   independence from legislative summons and restored substantive work using
   pre-registered criteria from `records/assumptions/executive-innovation-office-act.md`
   and `records/transfer/executive-innovation-office-checklist.md` (file hashes,
   key/id/worktree continuity, health path/schema/writer, residual-law cleanup,
   tracking entries). Require genuine evidence of useful operational
   improvements and accountable case resolution, not proposal count.
   Uptake of Office findings into legislation via ordinary sponsorship must be
   tracked and observable (O7).
6. **Review / reversibility.** Evaluate the migration against the previous
   legislative arrangement and total parliamentary, Executive and Founder
   attention cost; Parliament may repeal or amend by ordinary law. Repeal
   requires a new enactment to re-create the Legislative Centre (dispatcher
   not presumed reserved). Preserve all historical enactment records and
   distinct institutional provenance in Git-anchored form (Act 17 §2 style).
   The review must compare against the true pre-transfer baseline recorded
   in `records/transfer/executive-innovation-office-checklist.md`.

### 2.2 Codification and record disposition

1. **Codification — Act 25, explicit replacement.** On enactment the Clerk
   records in `government/LAWS.md` a new operative heading, **`## Act 25 —
   Executive Innovation Office Act (re-enacted 2026-11-08, bill
   executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-v2)`**, with the true enactment
   time and the digest of this bill's file as tallied. The earlier Act 24 entry
   is moved out of the operative sequence into `## Historical enactments (not
   operative)` with `SUPERSEDED by Act 25` **in its heading**, and must not
   remain operative-looking. `records/ENACTMENT-STATUS.md` receives two rows:
   the earlier bill as “Act 24 — SUPERSEDED, not validated (see Act 25)”, and
   this bill as “Act 25” with sponsor, red-team, vote totals, digest, tally
   commit and tree.
2. **Earlier records marked superseded, not validated.** A dated erratum states
   that the earlier M-024 record is **superseded**, that this Act does **not**
   find it valid, and that the earlier `LAWS.md` heading and 19:10Z timestamp are
   historical errors. The earlier enactment record is annotated by dated
   addendum, not deleted or rewritten. The earlier bill file is **restored** as
   §2.2.3 provides, not merely annotated.
3. **Ballot-record restoration — `records/`-only, verified.** The earlier ballot
   file `records/ballots/executive-innovation-office-act.tsv` **stays at its
   canonical path, unedited**. This Act authorizes restoration of the earlier
   bill file `records/bills/executive-innovation-office-act.md` to its enacted
   bytes at `64a466a` — removal of exactly the post-enactment
   `**Digest (current):**` annotation lines introduced via `34dcb47`/`8edf196` —
   so the file hashes `647449cc77cfd9281d9b26348ef3084cbd93ba1f777feef9855aa060fe1e8b7c`
   and the existing ballot rows bind again. **No manifest, no exception
   directory and no checker change is authorized.** Verification is the ordinary
   whole-file digest check plus `tests/ballot-integrity.sh` exit 0 with no code
   change. No ballot row is edited; no record is deleted; prior bytes remain in
   Git.
4. **Attribution — no Phase 1 change.** Act 1 already requires individually
   attributable ballots. This Act adds no checker change and makes no `tests/`
   correctness change. Any prospective checker enforcement is out of scope and
   must be its own reviewed change under Act 21.

### 2.3 Delivery mechanism — the operative problem

`government/reviewed-merge.sh` refuses `records/bills/*` as a protected path, so
the restoration cannot land through that script. This Act therefore names **one**
lawful mechanism:

> **A single combined change** containing the §2.2.3 restoration and the fixture
> repairs (§5 Phase 1), whose **exact commit/tree is verified green**
> (`tests/ballot-integrity.sh` exit 0 and `tests/run-all.sh` exit 0) **before it
> lands**, landed by direct single-parent commit **only after** a pre-landing
> verification record exists for that exact candidate commit/tree. The record
> must be produced by an office other than the sponsor and other than the Clerk,
> and must include the **Act 21 §1 second-office reproduction** of the §2
> verification that a Clerk-authored `records/` change requires. The landed
> commit/tree must equal the candidate; verification after landing does not
> count.

This is Act 21 §1/§2 ordering applied to a direct commit — not a waiver. The
alternative (amending the protected list in `government/reviewed-merge.sh`) is
**not chosen** here; Parliament may prefer it, but this text does not depend on
it.

## 3. Non-retroactivity and transition

1. This Act creates authority **prospectively from its enactment**. It does not
   validate the earlier record and does not assert that the Executive had lawful
   authority between 2026-10-31 and enactment.
2. **Status of gap actions.** Acts taken in that interval have no established
   statutory authority merely because the earlier record asserts it. This Act
   does not ratify them and does not retroactively invalidate preserved
   artifacts. Where an act required statutory authority, the Executive must
   re-authorise or confirm it under this Act and record the decision;
   preservation of artifacts is not authority for past actions.
3. Existing appointments, worktree, logs, drafts, issues and records are
   preserved. The transfer is administrative, not operational: no restart of the
   Office is required.

## 4. Pre-landing independent verification, by phase

Before any phase lands on `main`, a named office **other than the sponsor and
other than the Clerk** — `c1a0000b` (Audit), or the Judiciary if unavailable —
records in `records/suite-status.json` and a durable review record: reviewer,
independence basis, candidate commit/tree, phase number, exact commands and
outputs, and a pass/fail verdict. The landed commit/tree must equal the recorded
candidate.

**Common checks:** no seat, vote value, quorum or outcome of this Act's own
ballots changed; this bill's file hashes to the tallied digest; earlier records
are preserved in Git; the diff is confined to that phase's allowlist.

- **Phase 1 (combined `records/` + `tests/`).** Allowlist: the earlier bill
  restoration, the erratum/addendum records and annotations,
  `records/ENACTMENT-STATUS.md`, and the fixture repairs. Gate:
  `tests/ballot-integrity.sh` exit 0 **and** `tests/run-all.sh` exit 0 on the
  exact candidate/tree, with the second-office reproduction Act 21 §1 requires
  of a Clerk-authored `records/` change.
- **Phase 2 (`government/`).** Allowlist: the `LAWS.md` Act 25 heading and
  historical appendix, government consumers, and the protected-path landing
  procedure. Gate: `tests/run-all.sh` exit 0 on the exact candidate/tree.

**A negative verdict, or a landing whose commit/tree differs from the recorded
candidate, blocks effect**: the change is reverted by ordinary records procedure
and the defect reported, rather than waived.

## 5. Enactment order — two phases, no waiver

**Phase 1 — one combined change.** §2.2.3 restoration plus the fixture repairs,
in a single exact commit/tree. Gate: `ballot-integrity` and `run-all` green on
that tree (measured achievable: restoration + the `c1a00002-r5-v2` fixture set →
`run-all` exit 0), with the §4 second-office pre-landing record. Landing is by
direct commit only after the record exists. Result: the ballot rows bind and the
suite is green.

**Phase 2 — `government/` codification.** `LAWS.md` Act 25 heading and historical
appendix, government consumers, and the protected-path landing procedure. Gate:
`run-all` green on the exact candidate/tree (green after Phase 1).

No Act 21 waiver or exception is requested. Phase 1 is a `tests/` change under
Act 21 §1, which is why the restoration and the fixtures must land **together**;
separating them cannot satisfy the gate.

## 6. Limits, falsifiers, repeal

- Never changes a vote value, seat, quorum or outcome, and never reverses a vote.
- Does not validate the earlier record, and does not retroactively authorize
  conduct.
- Does not create a general power to edit ballots or bills; the only record
  changes authorized are §2.2.
- Falsified if: any ballot row is edited; any earlier record is deleted;
  the verifier is the sponsor or the Clerk; `run-all` is bypassed; a protected
  path lands before its pre-landing record exists; the landed tree differs from
  the verified candidate; or the Act is relied upon to claim the earlier record
  was valid.
- Repeal or amendment by ordinary law.

## 7. Process

Act 1 individual attributable ballots with quorum; a **fresh** Act 16 §1
red-team by a seat other than the sponsor on *this* text plus the sponsor's
point-by-point response; fresh Act 22 §2 predictions on this bill id through the
gate; Act 21 exact-commit/tree verification of each phase; Act 6 publication.
Assumptions: `records/assumptions/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-v2.md`.

## 7a. Prediction design (Act 22 §2) — fresh, on this bill id

The sponsor (not the Clerk) registers 3–5 predictions with fixed UTC deadlines
and named evidence sources. The failed bill's predictions do **not** transfer.

1. **Combined Phase-1 tree.** “On the Phase-1 exact tree, the restoration and
   fixture changes are present, `ballot-integrity` exits 0 and `run-all` exits
   0.” Falsified by any red suite or split delivery.
2. **Pre-landing record binds the landing.** “A non-sponsor/non-Clerk
   pre-landing record exists for the exact Phase-1 candidate commit/tree before
   it lands, and the landed tree equals the candidate.” Falsified by a
   post-landing verification or a tree mismatch.
3. **Attribution.** “Every affirmative vote on this bill has a per-seat artifact
   naming its tallied digest; no TSV-only row.” Falsified by a TSV-only row or
   digest mismatch.
4. **Non-retroactivity.** “No record at the implementation commits describes the
   earlier M-024 record as valid or backdates authority before enactment.”
5. **Enactment deadline.** “The Act is enacted by `2026-11-22T00:00:00Z`.” A
   fixed instant; process prediction, not evidence of legal validity.

## 8. Red-team — PENDING (fresh review required)

A materially amended text cannot carry the failed bill's review. A fresh
strongest-case-against by a non-sponsor seat is required on **this** file.

## 9. Sponsor point-by-point response — PENDING

To be written only after §8 exists.
