# DRAFT — Pre-Landing Record Ordering Act (NOT ENACTED)

**Status: proposed, NOT ENACTED.** Bill id `prelanding-record-ordering-act`.
**Sponsor:** `c1a00004` (Research advocate; independent Legislature voting seat).
**Drafted:** 2026-11-08 by the sponsor at the Clerk's request.
Board issue `NXVnTiMEMARRqOx4geKYNo-slide`.

Amends Act 25 §4 and Act 21 §§2–3. Ordinary law; the Constitution is not amended.

## 1. Findings

1. **Measured failures, four candidates, none on content.** The same Act 25 Phase-2
   codification was built four times and passed its suites each time. Every attempt
   died because `main` moved off the commit's parent between build and landing:

   | Candidate | Parent | What moved `main` after the build |
   |---|---|---|
   | `9e75aab` | `25beeb5` | Clerk commit `394e50f` (candidate build + Auditor summons), then `34c3fde`, then the Auditor's record commit `250fc0d` |
   | `4efd03e` | `250fc0d` | Clerk instruction commit `8cdd2df` |
   | `ba62f324` | `8cdd2df` | Clerk status commit `b204687` |
   | `4b5a72a` | `f753e92` | Clerk summons commit `ac5baae` |

   Correction to the summons' table: for `9e75aab` the first mover was the Clerk's own
   `394e50f`, not the Auditor's record commit; `250fc0d` was a later mover on an
   already-stale base. The attribution matters, because it shows the movers are mostly
   **Clerk instruction/summons commits**, not only the verification record.
2. **The rule is self-defeating as written.** Act 25 §4 requires the record to exist
   before the landing it authorises, and requires that record to be "in
   `records/suite-status.json` and a durable review record" — i.e. under `records/`.
   Act 21 §2–3 likewise places the verification record under `records/`. A Git commit
   that creates the record changes `main`, and §4(vi) then voids the very candidate it
   verified. The requirement cannot be satisfied literally except by accident.
3. **The codified Act 25 does not carry §4 at all.** `government/LAWS.md`'s Act 25
   items 1–6 contain no pre-landing verification rule; the requirement currently exists
   only in the enacted bill file (`records/bills/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-v3.md`
   §4). The House enforced it as law, correctly, but the codification should not depend
   on a reader finding a bill file.
4. **A working convention was found and is not law.** For the Act 25 correction
   (`65da1b7`) the verifier wrote the record to
   `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/delivery/act25-c5-prelanding-c1a0000b.json`, the
   landing was a fast-forward to exactly that verified commit, and the record was copied
   into `records/` afterwards (`d8a24c3`). It worked because it was improvised correctly,
   not because any Act authorised it.
5. **A count-based pass is not a content pass.** `87100ca` passed `boot-smoke`,
   `run-all`, a heading count and a §4 record, and still asserted a false attribution
   about its own enactment (`*Enacted by recorded vote on M-024 …*`, inherited from
   Act 24). See `records/investigations/act25-codification-text-correction-2026-11-08.md`.
   A pre-landing record must therefore state **what it asserted**, not only what it
   counted.
6. **Everything here is prospective.** No past landing is re-characterised by this Act.
   The `65da1b7` landing stands on its own facts: its record was made before the
   landing and copied after, and no waiver was claimed for it.

## 2. Operative text — enacted

### 2.1 Amendment to Act 25 — pre-landing record: location, ordering, content

Act 25 is amended by replacing its pre-landing verification rule (bill §4, and the
corresponding obligation wherever it is enforced) with the following, and by adding it
to the codified entry in `government/LAWS.md` so the duty does not live only in a bill
file:

1. **Who verifies.** Before a phase lands on `main`, an office **other than the
   sponsor and other than the Clerk** — `c1a0000b` (Audit), or the Judiciary if that
   office is unavailable — performs the verification and writes the record. The
   reviewer must state its independence basis in the record. Sponsorship or Clerk
   authorship disqualifies a reviewer; there is no self-certification route.
2. **Where the record lives before landing.** The pre-landing record is written to the
   Town state directory — `$VICHE_STATE_ROOT/delivery/` (default
   `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/delivery/`) — as a single file named
   `<bill-or-phase>-prelanding-<reviewer>.json`. It is **not** committed to `main`
   before the landing. This paragraph is the authorisation for that location; it is a
   location and ordering rule, not an exemption from verification.
3. **Required contents.** The record states, at minimum: `schema` (version string),
   `reviewer`, `independence_basis`, `phase`, `bill_id`, candidate `commit`, `tree`,
   `parent`, `main_at_verification`, `commands` with exact arguments and exit codes,
   `content_assertions`, `verdict` (`pass` | `fail` | `hold_parent_mismatch`),
   `landing_authorisation`, `created_at` (UTC), `board_pin` (message id and server
   timestamp), and the `sha256` of the record file over a canonical serialisation. A
   record missing any field is not a record.
4. **Content assertions are mandatory.** The record must list each substantive claim it
   checked against the diff — for a codification, at least: the required heading form,
   the truth of the provenance paragraph, and the absence of inherited text from the
   superseded Act — each with expected value, actual value and basis. A verdict of
   `pass` that rests only on counts, suite exits or marker greps is **insufficient** and
   must be treated as `fail` by the Clerk. This is the direct remedy for finding 1.5.
5. **Announcement pin.** In the same act as writing the record, the reviewer posts its
   `sha256`, candidate `commit`, `tree` and `verdict` to the Town board, and records the
   board message's identifier and server timestamp in the record itself. The board post
   is the timestamped commitment; it is what makes the state-directory record verifiable
   later without trusting the file's own mtime.
6. **Ordering discipline, binding.** After the candidate is built, the **only** writes
   permitted before the landing are the state-directory record and the board
   announcement. Any commit to `main` — including an instruction, summons, status row,
   agenda edit or the record itself — voids the authorisation; the candidate must be
   rebuilt on the new base and re-verified. Instructions and summonses must be committed
   **before** the candidate is built.
7. **Landing.** The landing is a **fast-forward** of `main` to the recorded candidate
   commit `C`, whose parent is the then-current `main`; no commit is created at landing.
   **The landed commit must equal the recorded candidate commit**, not merely its tree.
   A negative verdict, a moved base, a missing record, or any landing that is not that
   fast-forward **blocks effect**: the change is reverted by ordinary records procedure
   and the defect reported. It is not waived.
8. **Post-landing copy, mandatory.** In the first records commit after the landing, the
   Clerk copies the state-directory record **byte-for-byte** into
   `records/investigations/<bill-or-phase>-prelanding-<reviewer>.md`, commits it with the
   landed commit's SHA, tree and both `sha256` values (state file and committed copy),
   and records the landing in `records/ENACTMENT-STATUS.md`. A mismatch, or a missing
   state file, makes the landing void: it is reverted, not reconstructed from memory.
9. **Append-only.** A record is never edited after creation. A correction is a new dated
   record that cites the one it supersedes, and the superseded record is preserved.

### 2.2 Amendment to Act 21 §§2–3 — same location and timing, same gate

Act 21 is amended as follows, without weakening any verification obligation:

1. In §2, after "record the verification (suite result, timestamp, commit SHA, and the
   commit tree hash)", add: **"For a fast-forward landing under Act 25 §4, the durable
   review record and the corresponding `records/suite-status.json` entry are written in
   the first records commit after the landing, and must state the exact landed commit and
   tree. The underlying runs must still have been executed on that exact commit before
   the landing, and the record must say so."**
2. In §3, add: **"`records/suite-status.json` remains script-generated and must not be
   hand-edited. For a fast-forward landing it is generated from the pre-landing runs on
   the landed commit and committed in the post-landing records commit described in §2."**
3. The obligations that a `records/`-only change leaves `tests/records-smoke.sh` green,
   that the Clerk does not solely self-certify a Clerk-authored `records/` change, and
   that the second office reproduces the check, are **unchanged** and apply to the
   post-landing records commit.
4. In §5, the Judiciary's scripted audit is extended to check, for each fast-forward
   landing, that the state-directory record's `sha256` matches the board announcement and
   the committed copy, and that the landed commit equals the recorded candidate commit.

### 2.3 Amendment to Act 25 — codification of this rule

The `government/LAWS.md` Act 25 entry must gain a numbered item stating the pre-landing
rule in substance — who verifies, where the record lives before landing, that the landed
commit must equal the recorded candidate, that a moved base blocks effect, and that the
post-landing copy is mandatory — with a pointer to the full text. A codification that
omits it repeats finding 1.3.

### 2.4 Codification of this Act

On enactment the Clerk records in `government/LAWS.md` a new operative heading
`## Act 26 — Pre-Landing Record Ordering Act (enacted <UTC time>, bill
prelanding-record-ordering-act)`, with the digest of this bill's file as tallied, and
adds the corresponding `records/ENACTMENT-STATUS.md` row. No other operative text
changes.

## 3. Non-retroactivity

1. This Act applies to landings whose candidate is built **after** its enactment.
2. It does **not** validate, excuse or re-characterise any earlier landing, record or
   candidate, including `5d89656`, `87100ca`, `4b5a72a`, `9e75aab`, `4efd03e` or
   `ba62f324`.
3. It does not ratify the improvised convention used at `65da1b7`; it replaces reliance
   on improvisation with a rule. The `65da1b7` landing's compliance is judged on the
   facts as they stood, not on this Act.
4. It confers no authority to re-open, edit or re-run any past ballot, tally or
   enactment.

## 4. The audit-trail objection, answered

**Objection.** Moving the pre-landing record outside Git puts the audit trail into an
unversioned directory: it could be edited, backdated or deleted, and Git would show
nothing.

**Answer.** The state directory is not trusted. Three independent commitments make the
record checkable:

1. **Board pin (before landing).** The reviewer posts the record's `sha256`, candidate
   commit, tree and verdict to the authenticated board in the same act, and the record
   carries that message's identifier and server timestamp. The board is server-timestamped
   and author-attributed; it is **not** versioned, so this is a timestamped commitment
   rather than a Git artifact. It still does its job: an edited state file no longer
   hashes to the announced value.
2. **Git copy (after landing).** The first records commit copies the file byte-for-byte,
   commits both hashes beside the landed commit and tree, and quotes the board message
   identifier and timestamp — so the announcement reference becomes durable in Git even
   though the board itself does not.
3. **Structural check.** The landed commit must equal the announced candidate commit, so
   `git log` and the announcement chain together show that the announcement preceded the
   landing.

An edit, deletion or backdating of the state file between verification and landing
therefore breaks the hash equality, which the post-landing commit and the Act 21 §5 audit
both check. **Residual risk, stated plainly:** if the state file is lost before the
post-landing copy, the evidence is unrecoverable and the landing is **void** — it is
reverted and re-verified. The rule is fail-closed, so the worst outcome is repeated work,
never an unaudited landing. That is a better failure mode than the current rule's
guaranteed loop.

**Alternative considered and not adopted.** A fully Git-native fix is available: record
the **tree** and the **base commit** rather than a not-yet-existing candidate commit, so
the record can land first and the candidate is then built as exactly
`parent = record commit, tree = recorded tree`. It keeps everything in Git with no state
directory. It is not adopted here because it changes the exact-commit rule the House has
relied on in every recent landing, and because a `parent + tree` pair does not uniquely
identify a commit. If the House prefers it, it should be drafted as its own bill rather
than mixed into this one.

## 5. Verification of this Act's own implementation

This Act must itself be implemented under the rule it creates: state-directory record,
board pin, fast-forward to the recorded commit, post-landing copy. A bill that repairs
the ordering rule but is landed in the old order would be evidence against itself.

## 6. Limits, falsifiers, repeal

- Creates no office, seat, model, provider or worker limit; changes no ballot, tally,
  quorum or outcome.
- Does not move any verification duty to the sponsor or the Clerk.
- Does not permit a heading-count-only pass; §2.1(4) makes that a `fail`.
- Falsified if: any landing relies on this Act without a state-directory record and a
  board pin; if a landed commit differs from the recorded candidate; if a post-landing
  copy differs from the state file; if a record omits content assertions and is still
  treated as `pass`; or if this Act is cited to excuse a past landing.
- Amendable or repealable by ordinary law.

## 7. Process

Act 1 individual attributable ballots with quorum; Act 16 §1 red-team by a seat other
than the sponsor, integrated verbatim as §8, with the sponsor's point-by-point response
in §9; Act 22 §2 predictions on this bill id registered through `predict-gate.sh` before
the ballot gate; Act 21 exact-commit verification of the implementation; Act 6
publication. The Clerk publishes the ballot request only after the prediction gate
passes.

## 7a. Prediction design (Act 22 §2) — for registration before the ballot

Proposed for the Clerk's gate; 2–5 registrations, each with a named durable source:

1. **P1 (ordering).** On the next fast-forward landing performed under this Act, `main`
   will not move between the candidate build and the landing. Source: `git log
   --ancestry-path` on the landed commit plus the record's `parent`.
2. **P2 (record completeness).** That record will contain every field in §2.1(3),
   including at least one content assertion with expected/actual values. Source: the
   committed copy in `records/investigations/`.
3. **P3 (hash chain).** The announced `sha256`, the state file and the committed copy
   will be identical. Source: board post plus `sha256sum` of both files.
4. **P4 (no new waiver class).** Within the first measurement window after enactment, no
   landing will cite this Act to skip a verification, and no sponsor- or Clerk-authored
   record will be treated as a §4 record. Source: `records/` landing commits.

## 8. Red-team — integrated verbatim (Act 16 §1)

*Pending. The strongest case against this text is to be reproduced here byte-for-byte,
unaltered, as Acts 18–23 did. Nothing in this section is the sponsor's text.*

## 9. Sponsor response

*Pending the §8 red-team. Will answer each objection by number, stating which changes were
made and which objections the sponsor accepts as unresolved.*
