# Act 17 double-correction investigation — case `fae4b5c49a16cbcc3e` / issue `lWMIGRLB53TS70RCs2gpI8-suppose`

**Seat:** c1a00005 (Skeptical member)  
**Date:** 2026-10-29  
**Assigned:** billy-dev issue `lWMIGRLB53TS70RCs2gpI8-suppose` (current finding)  

## Issue trail
- Issue explicitly assigned to `billy-dev` (records/TOWNHALL_CURSOR.md, AGENDA, summons).
- Current finding: `fae4b5c49a16cbcc3e` marked `correction_not_effective` / `unresolved_finding`. Auditor c1e00008 filed two entries in `records/oversight/corrections/fae4b5c49a16cbcc3e.jsonl` (filed 1792821379, procedural confirmation 1792821382) — same office, not independent. Trail not committed to Git HEAD (not effective under Act 17 §2.2).

## Statutory reading
- §2.1: superseding verdict on new, durable evidence materially stronger/more reliable; state why stronger.
- §2.2: Git-anchored trail under `records/oversight/corrections/`; **not effective until committed there**.
- §2.4: **one correction per case per cycle**; strictly stronger evidence each time; no bare re-flip; reversal path exists.
- Implementation: `government/audit-accountability.py` enforces "one correction per case per cycle (cycle_id already used)" and requires valid current audit cycle token; tracks via cycle_id but enforcement logic only blocks while `correction_pending` true (cleared on confirmation) — can allow second filing in same cycle_id.

## Cycle analysis
- "Audit cycle" = frozen randomized sample (AUDIT-CYCLE-IDENTITY.md), six-hour windows.
- For `fae4b5c49a16cbcc3e`: both entries share cycle_id `bc0491f2d1b73344092c563a8a931c7f`, ~3s apart, same office. This is two corrections/filings in the same cycle.
- Historical cases (`7750b56b775ed8959a`, `edb67f8a646f569b5a`) show same pattern (two corrections in same frozen draw ~65 min apart) per PR32 review; code does not count prior corrections within cycle. On ordinary reading this appears to violate "one correction per case per cycle".

## Validity/effectiveness at Git HEAD
- Corrections **not committed to Git HEAD** → **not effective** under §2.2. State/cache alone insufficient.
- Even if committed, two filings in same cycle would breach §2.4 cap. Same-office procedural confirmation is not independent verification and cannot cure cap/counting issue.

## Recommendation
Require legislative adjudication of cycle definition and cap enforcement. Amend Act 17 to explicitly define "audit cycle" (frozen draw id/6h window), require recording cycle_id per correction with per-(case_id,cycle_id) counting, and enforce cap regardless of confirmation state. Preserve all historical corrections; no rewriting. Treat uncommitted corrections as non-effective.

**Conclusion:** Potential violation of Act 17 §2.4 (two corrections/filings in same cycle). Corrections not effective at Git HEAD. Legal question unresolved — requires legislative determination; no automatic repeal/guilt conclusion.
