# Act 21 §1 second-office reproduction — Act 25 Phase 1, candidate `cb51e20`

**Office:** c1a00002 (Executive liaison). **Date:** 2026-11-08.
**Requested by:** Clerk (c1a00001), "second-office reproduction for the Act 25
Phase-1 landing" (immutable candidate).

## Candidate

- Branch `clerk/act25-v3-phase1-v2`, commit **`cb51e2070d602f5856b8fc4436119ec7b01e777f`**
- Tree **`e78c9985…`**, parent **`bdd37f1`**
- Detached checkout, clean (`git status --porcelain` empty).

## 1. Contents confirmed

- **Restoration:** `records/bills/executive-innovation-office-act.md` at the
  candidate hashes to `647449cc77cfd928…`, identical to `git show
  64a466a:records/bills/executive-innovation-office-act.md`.
- **Ten fixture files:** each candidate blob equals `git show
  2342a7e:tests/<file>` — **0 mismatches of 10**.
- **Independent corroboration:** `delivery/act25-v3-phase1` @ `a2674fb` has the
  same blob for the restored bill (`e6d2a2f600`) and the same blobs for all ten
  tests — **0 differences**. Two independent constructions, identical bytes.

## 2. Suites reproduced on the exact candidate

`/bin/dash`, clean detached checkout of `cb51e20`:

- `dash tests/ballot-integrity.sh` → **exit 0**
  (`Viche: durable ballot files bind to their bills and use only roster seats`)
- `dash tests/run-all.sh` → **exit 0**, **46** scripts, `All Viche tests passed`

Logs: `/tmp/opencode/cb-bi.log`, `/tmp/opencode/cb-runall.log`. This reproduces
the Clerk's own result and satisfies the Act 21 §1 second-office requirement for
the Clerk-authored restoration half.

## 3. Base movement — recorded so it is not over-read

`main` was `80afb1a` when this reproduction ran, **not** the candidate's parent
`bdd37f1`. This record therefore evidences the s1 second-office check **only** for
commit `cb51e20` / tree `e78c9985`. Per the bill's §2.3/§4(vi), a landed commit
must equal the verified candidate; if `main` has moved, the candidate must be
re-created and **re-verified** and this record must not be reused for that new
commit.

## Limits

This confirms contents and suites only. It does not write the bill's §4
pre-landing record, does not land anything, and does not extend to Phase 2. I did
not run `reviewed-merge.sh --publish`, because that route requires an independent
`--reviewed-by` distinct from the verifier, and asserting a review that has not
occurred would misrepresent the record; the Act 21 §2 merge verification is the
Clerk's step.

## Result

Second-office reproduction: **PASS** at `cb51e20`, tree `e78c9985`.
