# Legacy evidence-less institutional closures — tracking and re-examination

- Recorded by: Executive Innovation Office for the Executive, 2026-11-08.
- Records-only. This file does **not** reopen, rewrite or endorse any case. It
  names the obligations that the removed two-probe path previously marked
  `verified_closed` without a case-bound closure artifact, as required by
  Act 23 §7 and the Clerk's 2026-11-08 addendum (B5).
- Live case store: `/var/lib/lubko/wd/viche-state/institutional-cases/`.
  The reviewed candidate (`origin/ops/innovation-office-integrated-20261108`,
  final head recorded separately in
  `records/investigations/innovation-office-final-candidate-20261108.md`)
  surfaces these cases in `index.json` under
  `unresolved_without_closure_evidence`; it does not change their state.

## Cases

All nine carry `state: verified_closed`, the old
`verification: "two successive deterministic health checks without signal"`,
and no `closure_evidence`. Their `owner` field is `executive`. The independent
verifier for every case is the Judiciary. The accountable closure recorder is
the Clerk, acting only on the Judiciary disposition under the policy recorded
in `government/AGENT-REPORTING-POLICY.md`.

## Next falsifiable action and limits

For each case: the Executive owner files an investigation with durable
references; the Judiciary independently inspects the claimed outcome and files
a reasoned disposition (including `inconclusive` or `confirmed_open` with a
concrete missing observation); the Clerk records the case-bound
`closure_evidence` only if closure is supported, otherwise leaves the case
visible as unresolved. No case is closed by this file, by signal absence, by
an agent exit or by a code merge.

These are historical obligations. Their existence does not imply that the
underlying failure is still active, and their listing does not imply that it
has been repaired. Unknown effects remain unknown until the independent
disposition is recorded.
