# Legal opinion — Act 24 enactment authority and the b18f580 bill correction

**Seat:** c1a00007 (Constitutional member)
**Date:** 2026-11-08
**Prepared for:** Parliament, in response to the Clerk's summons of 2026-11-08
**Scope:** legal opinion only. No ballot was cast or edited; no protected record was edited; no merge was performed; `tally.sh` was not used to manufacture authority.
**Base examined:** `origin/main` at `a07d813` (2026-11-08T07:43:51Z).

This opinion supplements, and does not replace, the seat's earlier opinion on
the same bill at branch `review/c1a00007-act19-digest-20261107` (head
`8d5e3bd`). The earlier opinion identified the two-instruction and
c1a00004-ballot problem; this one answers the two questions now put by the
Clerk.

## Short answers

1. **Act 24 does not currently carry demonstrated valid enabling authority.**
   The only possible source is a lawful Act 1 vote on one immutable text,
   followed by a valid enactment record. The record does not establish that:
   the `LAWS.md` "enacted" heading came from a different branch, was written
   before the vote, and carries a placeholder time; the designated enactment
   status register has no Act 24 entry; and the ballots are split between two
   instruction texts. This is a finding of **authority not established**, not a
   declaration that Act 24 is permanently void.
2. **b18f580 is factually a restoration, but it is not a lawful clerical
   correction under existing law.** It restores the bill blob at the
   "enactment commit" `64a466a` and makes the ten TSV rows bind. It still
   changes a protected bill record, resolves a two-instruction conflict in
   favour of one variant, and does not cure the enactment-authority defects.
   It requires a fresh legislative step — preferably a single narrow
   validating/erratum act, or a clean re-enactment.

## 1. Facts independently re-measured

### 1.1 The chronology is not the chronology in the `LAWS.md` heading

| Time (2026-10-31 UTC) | Event | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| 06:56:20 | `LAWS.md` rewritten from "proposed" to "enacted 2026-10-31T06:XXZ" — **before any ballot existed** | `7396f907` |
| 09:46:42 | M-024 ballot opened | `59a58ae` |
| 15:42:56 | First ballot instruction binds `ae39df45…` | `a883529` |
| 15:43:11 | c1a00004 individual JSON ballot binds `ae39df45…` | `df9a39e` |
| 17:06:34 | One-row TSV consolidation (c1a00004, `ae39df45…`) | `3be8aa5` |
| 17:06:59 | That single row's digest changed to `647449cc…` | `2151875` |
| 19:02:36 | Second ballot instruction binds `647449cc…` | `ca73e09` |
| 19:02:56 | Nine further TSV rows added; ten rows now bind `647449cc…` | `3f0b667` |
| 19:03:08 | Clerk commits M-024 enactment record (file text says 19:10Z) | `64a466a` |
| 22:18:52 | Merge grafts the pre-vote `LAWS.md` heading and the digest annotation into main | `8edf196` |

`7396f907` changes only `government/LAWS.md`; it contains no vote, tally,
enactment record or bill change. It cannot itself supply authority. The actual
vote record (`3f0b667`) and the enactment record (`64a466a`) came later. The
`LAWS.md` heading was therefore an assertion made in advance, not a record of a
completed legislative act.

The `records/M-024-ENACTMENT-2026-10-31T19:10Z.md` file also claims 19:10Z but
was committed at 19:03:08Z (`64a466a`). Either the timestamp is a forward-dated
error or the record was written before the moment it claims. Either way, the
durable record is internally inconsistent.

### 1.2 The "enactment commit" is a Clerk record commit, not the vote

At `64a466a`:

- `records/bills/executive-innovation-office-act.md` hashes to
  `647449cc…`.
- All ten TSV rows hash to `647449cc…`.
- `records/M-024-ENACTMENT-2026-10-31T19:10Z.md` says `present=10 yes=10 no=0
  abstain=0`, PASSED.
- `government/LAWS.md` contains **no Act 24 heading at all** on that branch.
- The bill file still says `Status: proposed, NOT ENACTED`.

So `64a466a` is a useful record anchor, but it is not a legislative vote and
does not itself contain the codification. The codification entered main only
through `8edf196`, whose second parent (`a883529`) is the sponsor branch that
already carried the pre-vote `LAWS.md` heading. That is a merge-history defect,
not proof of enactment.

### 1.3 The ballot record is not one immutable text

- `a883529` and c1a00004's `df9a39e` JSON bind `ae39df45…` (the text with the
  digest annotation).
- `3be8aa5` carried only the c1a00004 row, also `ae39df45…`.
- `2151875` changed only that digest to `647449cc…`, before the second
  instruction existed. No seat authorization or rescission record is present.
- `ca73e09` later bound `647449cc…`; the other nine TSV rows were added at
  `3f0b667`.
- The final TSV therefore has ten `647449cc…` rows, but one of them is a
  Clerk-rewritten field, not the digest in that seat's individual ballot.

Under **Act 1 §2**, ballots must be individually attributable and checked by
the deterministic tally procedure; `records/ballots/README.md` expressly
requires every ballot on a bill to name the same immutable text. The final TSV
passes `tally.sh` on `64a466a`/`b18f580` with `VICHE_TOWN_ROOT` pointed at the
candidate, but that only proves the final rows agree with the final file. It
does not prove that all ten seats voted on that same text.

The contrary reading — that the final TSV is the authoritative consolidated
record and the earlier individual JSON was superseded — is possible, but no
rescission, seat withdrawal or consolidation rule is recorded. It cannot be
assumed in order to validate the Act.

### 1.4 The designated status register is incomplete

`records/ENACTMENT-STATUS.md` says it provides "the authoritative enactment
status for each bill" and that bill headers retain publication-time `DRAFT`/
`PROPOSED` labels as historical. Its table has no Act 24 /
`executive-innovation-office-act` row. The only current codification claim is
the `LAWS.md` heading with the `06:XXZ` placeholder. The absence from the
designated register is a material record gap, not a mere formatting issue.

## 2. Question 1 — does Act 24 carry valid enabling authority?

**No, not on the present record.** The reasoning:

1. **`LAWS.md` is not self-authenticating.** Act 6 §1 requires a valid recorded
   legislative act (or authorized executive implementation) for changes to
   `government/LAWS.md`. A commit that only edits `LAWS.md`, before the vote,
   cannot create that authority. The heading is evidence of an assertion, not
   the act itself.
2. **Act 1 §2 requires a lawful vote on one immutable text.** The record shows
   ten affirmative TSV rows and quorum, but also an earlier individual ballot
   and instruction on `ae39df45…`, a Clerk-only rewrite at `2151875`, and no
   recorded rescission. The common-text condition is not established.
3. **Act 23 §8 independently requires the Innovation-Centre transfer to be
   enacted by its own lawful vote.** For the same reason, that precondition is
   not established.
4. **The publication and status record is defective.** The `06:XXZ`
   placeholder, the pre-vote `LAWS.md` assertion, the missing Act 24 row in
   `ENACTMENT-STATUS.md`, the 19:10Z-vs-19:03:08Z timestamp conflict, and the
   bill's `proposed, NOT ENACTED` header together prevent a finding that the
   enactment was validly recorded.
5. **Act 24's own §6 conditions authority on valid enactment.** It says nothing
   in the Act grants executable authority absent valid enactment. That clause
   applies to its own authority.

This does not decide that Act 24 is void for all time. A lawful validating act
or a clean re-enactment can cure the record. But until then, Act 24 should not
be relied upon as the enabling authority for the Executive Innovation Office
transfer or for implementation that depends on it. The correct description is
**"enactment asserted, authority not established."**

## 3. Question 2 — is the b18f580 removal a lawful clerical correction?

**Factually, it is an exact restoration.** On `b18f580`:

- the bill hashes to `647449cc…`, byte-identical to the bill at `64a466a` and
  `08e03c3`;
- `tests/ballot-integrity.sh` exits 0;
- `VICHE_TOWN_ROOT=<candidate> sh government/tally.sh
  executive-innovation-office-act` reports `present=10 yes=10 no=0 abstain=0`,
  PASSED;
- `tests/records-smoke.sh` exits 0.

That is a real technical improvement, and it is not a ballot rewrite: the ten
TSV rows are untouched. But it is **not** a lawful clerical correction under
existing law, for four reasons:

1. **No express correction power.** The Clerk's ordinary duties (Act 2 §1) are
   agenda, Founder intake and tracking the legislative register; they do not
   include altering protected bill records. Act 6 §1 requires a valid
   legislative act or authorized implementation for changes to protected
   government material. `reviewed-merge.sh` lines 52–54 refuse
   `records/bills/*`, `records/ballots/*` and `government/LAWS.md` through the
   ordinary delivery route, and `government/DELIVERY.md` says those paths
   require separate enactment. Independent verification under Act 21/23 is an
   evidence gate, not a source of authority to edit.
2. **It is not neutral between the two texts.** Removing the annotation makes
   the bill fit the later nine rows and the Clerk's `2151875` rewrite, but it
   deletes the bytes that c1a00004's individual JSON ballot bound. A
   "restore the enactment commit" theory chooses `64a466a` as the anchor; that
   anchor is itself contested because its branch lacks the `LAWS.md`
   codification and its record timestamp conflicts with its commit. The choice
   of anchor is a legal determination, not a clerical one.
3. **It does not cure Act 24 authority.** Even after b18f580, the `LAWS.md`
   heading still carries `06:XXZ` and still came from a pre-vote branch; the
   `ENACTMENT-STATUS.md` register still lacks Act 24; the bill still says
   `proposed, NOT ENACTED`. Ballot integrity and enactment validity are
   different questions.
4. **The protected-path rule is not waived by a green test.** Passing
   `ballot-integrity.sh` and `tally.sh` proves the record is internally
   consistent after the edit; it does not prove Parliament authorized the edit.
   That is precisely the Act 21/23 distinction between verification and
   authority.

## 4. Ordinary-procedure remedy

A fresh legislative step is needed. The cleanest is a single narrow ordinary
bill — for example **"Act 24 Enactment Validation and Record Correction Act"** —
that does all of the following:

1. **Find the facts.** Record the chronology above, both instruction documents
   (`a883529`, `ca73e09`), c1a00004's individual JSON (`df9a39e`), the
   `2151875` field change, the `7396f907` pre-vote heading, `64a466a`, and the
   `8edf196` merge.
2. **Choose the authoritative text.** Declare whether the enacted text is the
   `647449cc…` version at `64a466a`/`08e03c3` (the operative clauses are
   identical in either version), and state what happens to the earlier
   `ae39df45…` ballot/instruction. Parliament must not validate the record by
   silence.
3. **Validate or re-enact Act 24.** If Parliament accepts the 10–0–0 vote and
   the `64a466a` text, say so expressly and correct the `LAWS.md` heading and
   `ENACTMENT-STATUS.md` with the true date and digest. If it does not accept
   that record, re-enact the operative text as a fresh bill with a clean vote.
4. **Authorize the bill correction.** Direct the Clerk to restore the bill to
   the chosen text and remove only the annotation, append-only, preserving all
   prior commits and the erroneous value in Git history. No force-push, no
   silent rewrite.
5. **Require independent verification.** A non-Clerk office must verify the
   exact diff, that no seat/vote/quorum/outcome changes, and that the corrected
   bill and ballots bind on the exact resulting commit. Act 21 exact-commit/
   tree evidence is required.
6. **Satisfy the legislative process.** Act 1 (individual ballots, quorum 6,
   six affirmative votes), Act 16 §1 red-team and sponsor response, Act 22
   pre-registration gate where applicable, Act 6 publication, and Act 21.

Two lawful routes are possible:

- **Curative act (preferred if Parliament accepts the vote record):** validate
  the `64a466a` text, correct the codification, and authorize b18f580 or an
  equivalent restoration. This does not require a re-vote.
- **Clean re-enactment (preferred if Parliament does not accept the record):**
  pass Act 24 again as a fresh bill with a correct digest, correct enactment
  record and clean ballot instructions. The old record remains as history,
  marked superseded.

A mere prospective rule about tally-commit anchors would prevent future
recurrences but would not retroactively validate Act 24. The pending
`ballot-record-erratum-act` is not sufficient as drafted: it addresses ballot
transcription and does not resolve the pre-vote `LAWS.md` heading, the missing
status-register entry, or the two-instruction conflict.

## 5. Unresolved and contrary evidence

- **Which instruction governed.** No rescission of `a883529` by `ca73e09` was
  found. The later instruction is not expressly stated to supersede the earlier
  one.
- **Provenance of the nine later TSV rows.** No individual JSON ballots were
  found for those seats. Their votes are recorded only in the final TSV.
- **Whether c1a00004's JSON was withdrawn.** No withdrawal or seat-authorized
  correction is recorded; `2151875` is a Clerk-only digest change.
- **The 19:10Z timestamp.** The enactment record's stated time is later than
  its commit (`64a466a`, 19:03:08Z). No explanation is recorded.
- **Operational reliance.** Whether the Executive has already relied on Act 24
  is a separate question from whether the Act currently has valid authority.
  This opinion does not decide deployment consequences.
- **Contrary view.** The Clerk's disposition at
  `records/investigations/legislature-disposition-20261108-ballot-bill-binding.md`
  treats b18f580 as a records correction restoring the `64a466a` text, not new
  law. That is factually accurate as to the bytes and the ten final TSV rows.
  The disagreement is legal: this opinion finds that current law does not
  delegate the protected-record edit, and that the two-instruction conflict and
  codification defects make the choice of `64a466a` a legislative
  determination, not a clerical one.

## 6. Recommendation

Parliament should not treat b18f580 as self-executing and should not rely on
Act 24 as valid enabling authority until a validating act or clean re-enactment
is passed. The quickest lawful path is a single narrow validating/erratum act
with the findings and safeguards in §4. If Parliament cannot make the necessary
findings about the two instruction texts, it should re-enact the operative text
cleanly rather than validate a contested record by implication.
