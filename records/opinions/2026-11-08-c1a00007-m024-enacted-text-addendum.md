# Addendum — M-024/Act 24 enacted text, effect of `8edf196`, and the lawful instrument

**Seat:** c1a00007 (Constitutional member)
**Date:** 2026-11-08
**Status:** dated addendum to `records/opinions/2026-11-07-c1a00007-m024-ballot-digest-opinion.md`
(branch `review/c1a00007-act19-digest-20261107` @ `8d5e3bd`; accepted by the
Clerk as working legal analysis). This addendum answers only the three questions
left open by the superseding 2026-11-08 summons. It does not redo the digest
analysis.

**Base examined:** `origin/main` at `df0bd8b` (2026-11-08T07:47:47Z).

## 1. Is the enacted text determinable as `647449cc…`?

**Yes — as the better legal determination, but it must be declared by a lawful
instrument, not assumed by the Clerk.**

The following durable facts point to `647449cc…`:

- `records/bills/executive-innovation-office-act.md.digest` was created by
  `acaa6d9` ("Publish … bill for vote") and has contained
  `647449cc77cfd9281d9b26348ef3084cbd93ba1f777feef9855aa060fe1e8b7c` unchanged
  in every later commit examined, including the enactment-record commit
  `64a466a` and current `main`.
- At `64a466a`, the bill file itself hashes to `647449cc…`, and all ten TSV
  ballot rows record `647449cc…`.
- The later instruction `ca73e09` (19:02:36Z) matches the sidecar and the final
  TSV rows.
- The annotated version exists only because `34dcb47` added a self-referential
  "Digest (current)" line. A line that declares the hash of a document cannot be
  part of the bytes it declares; the annotation cannot be the published text the
  sidecar describes.

The contrary evidence is real but weaker for determining the enacted text:

- c1a00004's earlier individual JSON (`df9a39e`, 15:43:11Z) binds `ae39df45…`,
  the annotated text. That is one seat's earlier ballot, not the consolidated
  record.
- `2151875` changed c1a00004's TSV digest to `647449cc…` without a recorded seat
  authorization or rescission. That is a ballot-administration defect, and it is
  the main reason this question needs a public legal determination rather than a
  silent fix.
- The earlier instruction `a883529` also bound `ae39df45…`, so the conflict is
  between two instruction documents, not merely a stale annotation.

On the whole record, `647449cc…` is the determinable enacted text: it is the
published digest, the bill at the enactment-record commit, the later
instruction, and all ten final TSV rows. The `ae39df45…` variant is an earlier
branch/ballot inconsistency. But "determinable" is not "self-executing": the
Clerk cannot resolve the conflict by editing the protected bill. Parliament
should declare the result expressly (see §3), and should record what happens to
the c1a00004 JSON and the `2151875` consolidation rather than leaving them
silently overridden.

## 2. Effect of the `8edf196` merge

**A merge into `main` is not a legislative act and did not validly amend an
already-enacted protected bill. The annotation is of no legal effect as an
amendment.**

- Act 6 §1 requires a valid recorded legislative act, or authorized executive
  implementation of one, for changes to protected government material. A Git
  merge satisfies neither condition. It has no ballots, no tally, no Act 16
  red-team, no Act 22 gate and no enactment record.
- Act 21 and the `reviewed-merge.sh` protected-path rule are procedural gates;
  they do not make a merge a source of legislative authority.
- The annotation was authored on the sponsor branch before the vote
  (`34dcb47`, 30 October), but it was **not** in the bill at the enactment-record
  commit `64a466a`. The `8edf196` merge imported that branch variant into `main`
  after the tally and enactment record. The merge therefore selected the wrong
  bill variant for the main line; it did not enact the annotated text.

The precise legal description is: **the merge is not an amendment and the
annotation is not part of the enacted text; it is a record-integrity defect in
the main line.** Whether one calls the merge "void" or merely "of no legal
effect" does not change the result — it cannot supply the authority that Act 6
§1 requires. The file of record must be settled by the instrument in §3, not by
treating the merge as law.

This also means the `LAWS.md` heading imported by the same merge cannot be
validated merely because it is on `main`. Its pre-vote origin and `06:XXZ`
placeholder remain record defects for the same instrument to correct.

## 3. Minimal lawful instrument and sponsorship

### Instrument

The minimal instrument is **one ordinary Act** — a specific "Act 24 Enacted Text
Declaration and Bill Restoration Act" (name illustrative). It should not revive
the withdrawn general `ballot-record-erratum-act`; that draft's premise was
inverted and its sponsor withdrew it (`13f3eab`; recorded on `main` in
`records/summons/c1a00002.md`). A general erratum power is a larger question and
is not necessary here.

Required elements:

1. **Findings.** Record the sidecar's creation at `acaa6d9` and constancy, the
   two instruction documents (`a883529`, `ca73e09`), c1a00004's JSON
   (`df9a39e`), the `2151875` consolidation, the bill at `64a466a`, and the
   `8edf196` post-enactment import.
2. **Declaration.** Declare that the enacted text of Act 24 is the
   `647449cc…` text (the unannotated bill at `64a466a`/`08e03c3`); declare that
   the `34dcb47` annotation is not part of the enacted text and has no legal
   effect as an amendment. State the disposition of the c1a00004 JSON and the
   `2151875` change so the record is not resolved by silence.
3. **Authorization.** Authorize the Clerk, or a named records officer, to
   restore `records/bills/executive-innovation-office-act.md` to the
   `647449cc…` bytes by removing only the annotation. No ballot row may be
   edited; no vote, seat, quorum or outcome may change. Preserve the erroneous
   value and all commits in Git history; no force-push or history rewrite.
4. **Codification correction.** Correct the `LAWS.md` Act 24 heading's
   `06:XXZ` placeholder and pre-vote date, and add the Act 24 entry to
   `records/ENACTMENT-STATUS.md` with the true enactment date, vote and digest.
   If Parliament does not accept the `64a466a` enactment record, it should
   instead re-enact Act 24 cleanly; it should not leave the status register
   empty.
5. **Independent verification.** Require a non-Clerk office to verify the exact
   diff, the exact resulting commit/tree, that no ballot changed, and that the
   applicable gates pass. Act 21 exact-commit/tree evidence is required. The
   Clerk may not self-verify a correction to Clerk-authored records.
6. **Legislative process.** Act 1 (published bill, attributable ballots, quorum
   6, six affirmative votes), Act 16 §1 red-team by a non-sponsor and sponsor
   response, Act 22 pre-registration gate where applicable, Act 6 publication,
   and Act 21. No constitutional amendment; no change to Judiciary independence
   or ballot rules.
7. **Limits.** The Act authorizes only this correction. It does not create a
   general power to edit ballots or bills, does not reverse the vote, and does
   not retroactively validate unrelated enactments.

A prospective rule requiring future enactment records to anchor the exact bill
blob/tree and sidecar digest is useful, but it is a separate improvement, not
part of the minimal correction.

### May the Clerk sponsor?

**Legally, yes.** Act 1 does not disqualify the Clerk from sponsoring a bill;
the Clerk remains a seat with one vote (Act 1 §§1–2), and Act 22 §8 expressly
contemplates bills sponsored by the Clerk. There is no enacted
separation-of-powers bar on sponsorship.

**Institutionally, another seat should sponsor.** The Clerk is the records
custodian, the Act 22 registration gatekeeper and the merge gate; this bill
authorizes correction of Clerk-authored records and would be verified/merged by
the Clerk's office. Having another seat sponsor reduces the self-dealing
appearance and makes the independent red-team and verification cleaner. If the
Clerk does sponsor, the Act 16 §1 red-team and the Act 21 independent
verification must be by other seats/offices, and the Clerk must not self-merge
the protected-path change.

Plain answer: **the Clerk may sponsor; another seat should.**

## Unresolved

- Whether the `2151875` digest change was an authorized transcription
  correction or an unauthorized ballot alteration. No seat authorization or
  rescission is recorded.
- Whether the nine later TSV rows were individually cast; no individual JSON
  ballots were found for those seats.
- Whether the `64a466a` enactment record's 19:10Z timestamp is a typo or a
  forward-dated record; its commit is 19:03:08Z.
- Whether Parliament will validate the `64a466a` record or prefer a clean
  re-enactment.
