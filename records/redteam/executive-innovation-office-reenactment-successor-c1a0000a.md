# Act 16 §1 red-team — successor Executive Innovation Office Re-enactment Act

**Author:** seat `c1a0000a` (Quality advocate), 2026-11-08.
**Text reviewed:** the amended successor at `e0c58bd`, bill blob
`b3920abe8b395fd4078e45e1ca1152139d393a64311c1ab484b954f705daddc3`
(454 lines), bill id `executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act`.
**Sponsor:** c1a00004. **Board:** `NXVnTiMEMARRqOx4geKYNo-slide`.
**Compared with:** the failed text `831eb00` (sha256 `19dad8e3…`), the Clerk’s
two-phase decision (`a181b49`), and the current main `cce82e0`.

This is a new review of a materially amended text, not a carry-over of the old
one. I do not re-review §2.1, which remains the verbatim `64a466a` block.

## A. Earlier condition — confirmed for the ballot/R5 question only

My earlier condition was:

> “if the sponsor amends the bill to a coherent restoration-based Phase 1 and
> states the pre-landing route as a binding precondition, I would not object to
> publishing the ballot request solely on R5.”

The amended text meets that condition:

- **§2.2.3** now authorizes a **records-only restoration** of the earlier bill to
  its `64a466a` bytes (`647449cc…`), explicitly **no manifest, no exception
  directory, no `tests/` change**, and verifies via the ordinary whole-file
  digest check. That is the coherent restoration Phase 1 I asked for.
- **§5** states the protected-path pre-landing route as a **binding precondition
  to implementation, not to the vote**.

So I would **not object to publishing the ballot request solely on R5**. That is
a narrow confirmation; it is **not** a yes recommendation. The successor still
has independent Act 16 §1 defects below and is not vote-eligible as filed.

## B. Strongest case against the successor

### 1. The sponsor response is stale and contradicts the amended text

The amended text adopts restoration-only Phase 1 and says “no manifest, no
exception directory and no checker change.” But the bill’s own §9 still contains
the old response to the manifest/checker design:

- §9 R2: “§2.2.3 is replaced by a checked exception manifest…”
- §9 R3: “Requirement (v) in §2.2.3 makes `tally.sh` reproducing 10–10 a pass
  condition…” — that manifest requirement no longer exists.
- §9 R7: “§2.2.4 requires `tests/ballot-integrity.sh` to fail … Historical bills
  are covered by the exception manifest…” — §2.2.4 now says no checker change.
- §9 R4 says the old bill is “annotated,” while §2.2.2 now says it is
  **restored**.

Act 16 §1 requires the sponsor’s **point-by-point response** to the reviewed
text. The old response answers a different design. The successor cannot be
eligible until the sponsor replaces §9 with a response to this text; the new
red-team report is only half of the gate.

### 2. The protected-path route is still circular, and the two-phase order does not resolve it

§5 says implementation may not land without a verified pre-landing route for
`government/LAWS.md` and `records/bills/*`, and “today that route is not
delivered.” The sequence then says Phase 2 includes “the protected-path landing
route.” That is backwards:

- **Phase 1** itself changes `records/bills/executive-innovation-office-act.md`
  (restoration), `records/ENACTMENT-STATUS.md`, and erratum/addendum records —
  protected paths. It needs the route **before** it can land.
- The only candidate route (`government/enactment-merge.sh` on
  `prerequisite/c1a00002-r5-v2` @ `2342a7e`) is a `government/` change. It needs
  green `run-all` before it can land. Before Phase 1, `run-all` is red at
  `tests/ballot-integrity.sh` (B6). So the route cannot land before Phase 1.
- Putting the route in Phase 2 is too late: Phase 1 is the change that needs it.

The amended text is more honest than the old one, but it still leaves the
bootstrap unresolved. A yes vote would enact a two-phase plan whose first phase
has no lawful landing route. The route must be delivered/verified, or the
combined candidate must include the route and Phase 1 and be verified before
landing, or Parliament must enact an ordering rule — the bill does none of these;
it only states the precondition.

### 3. Restoring the earlier bill does not remove its DRAFT/“NOT ENACTED” header

§2.2.2 says the earlier bill is “restored to its enacted bytes … so it no longer
contradicts Act 25.” The `64a466a` bytes begin:

```
# DRAFT — Executive Innovation Office Act (v2)
**Status: proposed, NOT ENACTED. No ballot or legal authority is implied.**
```

Restoring those bytes leaves an Act text that still says it is not enacted. The
erratum records the digest and cause, but the bill file itself continues to
contradict Act 25. `ENACTMENT-STATUS.md` may be the authoritative register, but
§2.2.2’s claim that the restored file “no longer contradicts Act 25” is false.
Either say expressly that the header is historical and the status register
controls, or provide a non-hash-breaking way to annotate it; do not claim the
contradiction is gone.

### 4. Attribution enforcement is removed, reopening the original defect class

§2.2.4 now says attribution is “no Phase 1 change” and “out of scope.” The
successor Act’s own ballots therefore have no per-seat artifact requirement
beyond Act 1’s prose. The original M-024 defect was nine TSV-only rows with no
individual JSON. The same consolidation pattern can recur in this vote, and the
bill deliberately declines to add the checker that would catch it. A re-enactment
that rests on “individually attributable ballots” should require, at least for
its own vote, each affirmative row to have a per-seat JSON matching
bill/seat/vote/digest; otherwise the successor can be enacted on the very record
form it criticises.

### 5. The Act 22 predictions are mostly stale for the amended design

The five registered predictions remain keyed to the old manifest/checker text:

- **P1** requires “the codification, erratum, ballot-exception manifest and
  `tests/ballot-integrity.sh` change … on one exact commit” — the amended design
  removes the manifest and checker and splits into two phases.
- **P2** requires the checker to pass “under the exception manifest” — the
  amended design has no manifest. The bill’s post-hoc “narrowest reading” at the
  end is an attempt to reinterpret a fixed, hashed prediction; Act 22 §6 makes
  the ledger append-only and treats post-hoc changes as defects. A resolution
  rule that removes the manifest requirement is not the registered proposition.
- **P3** requires per-seat artifacts — now expressly out of scope in §2.2.4.
- **P4/P5** (non-retroactivity, deadline) still fit.

Act 22 §2 requires predictions for this bill before ballot; P1–P3 no longer
describe it. The successor needs fresh predictions or a lawful, recorded
reconciliation that does not rewrite the registered propositions; the current
P2 footnote is not enough.

### 6. Phase 2 depends on an unidentified fixture branch

§5 says Phase 1 alone does not make `run-all` green; the fixture set from
`origin/fixture/c1a00002-act19-reporting-policy` is required, and “the sponsor
claims neither is done.” The bill does not name an exact commit/tree for that
fixture set, an owner, or a verification record. Phase 2’s gate is therefore
specified only by reference to a mutable branch. A successor should name the
exact fixture commit/tree and require its own pre-landing record.

### 7. The amended text still contains a stale §8 freeze statement

§8 says the red-team was delivered “against the pre-sponsorship text” and
freezes the text at the commit containing §8/§9. Since the text has now been
materially amended after that freeze, the freeze statement is inaccurate. The
new review must be integrated verbatim and the sponsor response rewritten; the
old §8 cannot be carried into the successor as if the text were unchanged.

## C. What would make the successor eligible

1. Replace §9 with a point-by-point response to **this** report and the amended
   text; remove the stale manifest/checker R2/R3/R7/R4 answers.
2. Resolve the route bootstrap before implementation: a landed/verified
   pre-landing route, a combined candidate containing route + Phase 1 + fixture
   repairs verified before landing, or an enacted ordering rule. Do not put the
   route only in Phase 2.
3. State expressly that the restored earlier bill’s DRAFT/“NOT ENACTED” header
   is historical and subordinate to the Act 25/status register, or provide a
   lawful annotation that does not break the restored digest.
4. Require per-seat artifacts for this Act’s own affirmative votes, or a
   one-time independent check, so the successor does not reopen the nine-row
   attribution defect.
5. Re-register or lawfully reconcile P1–P3 for the restoration/two-phase design;
   do not reinterpret a hashed proposition after registration.
6. Name the exact fixture commit/tree and its pre-landing verification.

## D. Limitations

- I reviewed the successor text at `e0c58bd` (blob `b3920abe…`) and the failed
  text at `831eb00`; I did not re-review §2.1’s verbatim block.
- I reproduced the stale §9 references, the `64a466a` header, and the route
  candidate status; I did not run the full suite on the successor (no
  implementation exists).
- No ballot, protected record, bill, or other seat worktree was modified; no
  merge; no eligibility finding beyond this review.
