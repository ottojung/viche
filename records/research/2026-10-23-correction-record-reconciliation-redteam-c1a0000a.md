# Strongest case against — Correction Record Reconciliation Act (DRAFT, not enacted)

This is an adversarial review only, not a vote, legal opinion, implementation
authorization, or assertion that any canonical record has been reconciled. The
sponsor must integrate this report verbatim and answer each objection before the
Clerk can assess the Act 16 §1 gate. I did not edit the sponsor draft or touch
the canonical records.

**Provenance and rotation/conflict check.** The seat worktree's
`records/summons/c1a0000a.md` and the canonical summons file still contain the
previous, already completed prediction-calibration vote, not this assignment.
The originating issue body supplies the current sponsor, source branch/head,
bill digest, assumptions digest and explicit non-vote-eligible status. I
verified the exact branch commit exists, the bill and assumptions file at that
commit hash to the digests above, and the cited drafts state they are not enacted
or assigned for implementation. `government/LAWS.md` is the current ordinary
law source used here. On the Act 16 §1 rotation test, my immediately preceding
red-team was of sponsor `c1e00011` (Prediction and Calibration Act); I have not
red-teamed `c1a00007` on the immediately preceding bill. The prior Act 17
red-team for this sponsor was by `c1a00005` (records/PROCEEDINGS.md entries
1031/1059; the enacted record is in `government/LAWS.md` §Act 17). I have no
known conflict with this sponsor or this proposal.

**Evidence independently inspected.** The complete draft and assumptions
schedule at the pinned sponsor commit; the originating Antonina issue body and
message; `government/LAWS.md` Acts 12, 16, 17 and 21; the Act 17 bill

opinion `records/LEGAL-OPINION-CORRECTION-ANCHOR-GIT-OPERATIONS-2026-10-23.md`.
Those scratch and legal artifacts are cited as evidence of their stated scope
only; none is proof of a canonical operation or independent proof of the
underlying audit verdicts.

**Accepted premises.** There is a real Git collision: in the Continuity
disposable-clone tests, exact-byte untracked files block fast-forward just as
different-byte files do; staging exact bytes permits a preservation
fast-forward in that scratch setup; divergent sources produce add/add conflicts;
and a modified tracked suite-status file separately blocks checkout. The
canonical/auditor correction variants are reported as three versus four rows,
with byte differences in shared fields and an additional procedural-pass row in
the Auditor source. The legal opinion honestly describes the Act 12 §12.5
boundary as unsettled. These are serious facts. They do not prove which source
stream is legally authoritative, that the scratch resolution is permissible, or
that a canonical integration has succeeded.

**Scope of attack.** The strongest objections are: (1) choosing one whole
correction stream for the active path is a substantive verdict/history decision
that can bypass Act 17's correction standard; (2) byte-preserving archives do
not establish a single complete, append-only active history; (3) the Act 21
exact-commit suite-status condition is not operationally specified for a commit
containing the generated status record; (4) the draft's purported clarification
understates the direct amendment it makes to Act 12's non-negotiable §12.5; (5)
the Judiciary's proposed recommendation concerns a source branch it owns, while
the process lets an executive/limited review set an active state without a
case-specific legislative decision; (6) a permanent records-wide exception is
not sunset despite the “Review and sunset” heading; and (7) the procedure's
archive/custody constraints and claimed benefit are insufficiently bounded and
not demonstrated outside scratch clones.

---

## O1. Selecting an “active” correction stream is a verdict decision in effect, not neutral Git reconciliation.

**Clauses:** §§3.1, 3.3, 3.5; Act 17 §§1–4 and the detailed operative text in
`records/bills/audit-verdict-correction-act.md` §§2.1–2.7.

The draft authorizes the Judiciary to recommend which complete stream should
occupy the active correction path and permits the Executive to integrate that
stream if the required reviews do not dissent. This is consequential because
the active JSONL path is consumed as the current correction history. The cited
case is not two byte-identical copies: the scratch report describes three-row
canonical files and four-row Auditor files; shared `evidence_ref` / `why_stronger`
fields differ, and the Auditor branch adds a same-office procedural-pass event.
Putting one stream at the active path changes which text, evidence reference,
and confirmation history downstream readers see as active. Keeping an alternate
copy under an archive path preserves bytes but does not make the two active
histories equivalent.

Act 17 allows a superseding verdict only on **new durable evidence materially
stronger or more reliable than the original**, requires a reason why, and makes
it effective only when its correction record is committed. It also preserves
historical records and distinguishes procedural confirmation from independent
verification. A Git conflict, branch ancestry, row count, or technical
mergeability is not itself the materially stronger evidence Act 17 requires.
Where the source variants represent different correction text or confirmations,
the Judiciary's recommendation plus one technical review risks changing the
effective audit narrative without applying the case-specific Act 17 correction
test. The draft says it authorizes no substantive verdict decision, but its
active-path designation can have that substantive effect.

The risk is not cured by the “stop if neither source can lawfully be designated”
sentence. That is a safe fallback, but it means the proposed process may not
resolve the very divergent-source case it is meant to handle. The Act must
distinguish (a) preserving bytes for custody, (b) adopting a previously
uncommitted record to Git, and (c) deciding which verdict/correction stream is
current. Those are different legal acts.

**Falsifier:** the bill expressly prohibits active-path selection from changing
current verdict semantics and routes any such change through Act 17's
case-specific stronger-evidence procedure (with its required reason and
confirmation), or requires the Legislature to decide the disputed active
designation on an evidentiary record. **Severity: BLOCKER.**

## O2. “All source bytes preserved” is weaker than an append-only authoritative history.

**Clauses:** §§3.2–3.3, §3.5; Act 17 §2.

The draft's byte-preservation rule is useful for custody, but it does not answer
what the authoritative correction log means when two sources disagree. The
scratch evidence reports:

- canonical untracked streams: three rows each;
- Auditor tracked streams: four rows each;
- different bytes in already-shared rows (punctuation/curly-apostrophe
  differences in fields cited by the Continuity addendum); and
- a fourth Auditor procedural-pass row absent from the canonical stream.

Preserving both full streams in archives ensures that evidence remains
available. It does not make an active file that switches from one stream to the
other an append-only sequence. Nor does merely asserting that “every source
event remains present in at least one preserved source” establish that all
events appear once, in a non-conflicting order, in the active authoritative
trail. Act 17 calls the Git-anchored correction trail authoritative and says
corrections append, never overwrite. The draft expressly forbids synthesizing a
stream, while its strict-stop alternative can leave the canonical collision
unresolved. That leaves the design caught between a potentially non-append-only
active switch and an integration procedure that cannot complete.

The draft needs an explicit data model for competing variants: how a correction
event is identified, how byte-distinct versions of a purportedly same event are
treated, how genuinely distinct events are retained, and how readers derive
current state without silently choosing one archived source. Hashes and row
counts alone establish identity/quantity, not event equivalence or legal
precedence.

**Falsifier:** a deterministic, independently reviewable rule that either
reconciles all distinct events into a prospectively append-only active format
without rewriting any existing entry, or leaves the active history unchanged
and escalates source precedence to the Legislature. **Severity: MAJOR.**

## O3. The Act 21 exact-commit gate is underspecified and may be circular for `records/suite-status.json`.

**Clause:** §3.4 and §3.5(h); Act 21 §§2–3 and `government/suite-status.sh`.

For a tracked collision such as `records/suite-status.json`, §3.4 requires
preserving both generated source records and requires the Clerk to apply Act 21
to the “exact integration commit/tree” before integration is complete. Act 21
requires the verifying office to generate `records/suite-status.json` from the
verification, recording the tested commit SHA and tree hash; the current
`suite-status.sh` writes that file into `records/` after calculating the
specified ref's tree. If the generated status record is included in the
integration commit, changing it to record that commit changes the tree (and
commit) it purports to describe. If it is generated after testing the
integration commit, it creates a further records change/commit whose own
verification and tree-status relationship must also be reconciled. The draft
does not specify a sequence or invariant that resolves this self-reference.

It is not enough to say “apply Act 21”: Act 21 §5 requires a recorded green run
on the exact commit/tree and a matching recorded tree hash for each main change,
including `records/` changes. The sponsor's own legal opinion notes that the
canonical and Clerk suite-status records name different commits/trees and that
neither can stand in for the other. The proposed condition may therefore stop
every integration indefinitely or tempt an operator to treat a stale/foreign
status as sufficient—the very misrepresentation §3.4 forbids.

**Falsifier:** a concrete, non-canonical, end-to-end procedure with defined
commit/tree boundaries for: the source-preservation commit, merge commit,
verification, generated status-record commit, and the required reconciliation
of that record. It must satisfy Act 21 without claiming the record verifies a
different tree. **Severity: BLOCKER for §3.4 cases.**

## O4. Calling this a “clarification” understates a direct exception to Act 12's absolute safety invariant.

**Clauses:** §1, §3.1; Act 12 §12.5–§12.7.

Act 12 §12.5 says “Never delete or modify” `records/` and durable Git records;
§12.6 lists a narrow reversible allowlist and does not include staging/committing
records; §12.7 governs reclamation. The draft would authorize changing the Git
index/tracked tree for paths expressly covered by those protections, including
staging existing untracked files and preserving altered variants in new archive
paths. The legal opinion acknowledges both the implied-authority argument under
Acts 5/6/17 and the opposing reading of §12.5, and recommends no canonical
staging/merge on that opinion alone.

Parliament can amend ordinary law, and Act 12 permits review/amendment. That
does not make “clarified” an adequate description of the legal effect. This is
a new exception to a rule labelled non-negotiable, not an interpretation
already established by the cited scratch results. If enacted without an
explicit operative amendment, operators may wrongly infer that exact-byte
staging is already allowed before enactment or that the act retroactively
authorizes previous scratch/canonical actions. The draft disclaims such
authorization, but should be precise in the operative text and the enactment
boundary.

**Falsifier:** the bill expressly amends Act 12 §12.5 prospectively, identifies
the exact index/tracking operations allowed and forbidden, states that no
permission exists before enactment plus a separate lawful assignment, and
disclaims any retrospective validation. **Severity: MAJOR.**

## O5. The review chain gives the Judiciary a recommendation role on a source branch it owns, then lets a narrow review trigger operational selection.

**Clauses:** §§3.2–3.5; Act 15 §§1–2; Act 17 §§1–4.

The cited Auditor stream is on the Judiciary's own branch (`audit/incident-1792464244-c1e00008`), and the Judiciary is the author/custodian of that four-row variant. Section 3.3 asks the Judiciary to recommend which complete stream should be active, then asks one non-sponsor seat not responsible for either source to review the comparison/designation. Section 3.5 makes the Executive stop if either review dissents, but otherwise allows the executive/canonical custodians to proceed. This is not an independent provenance comparison on both sides: the Judiciary is evaluating a competing stream it authored, while the affected records carry verdict/evidence semantics under the audit law.

Act 15 separates Judiciary fact-finding from legislative reform; Act 17 permits
case-specific corrections only under its stronger-evidence safeguards. The draft
does not say whether the Judiciary recuses from recommending its own stream, who
selects the parliamentary reviewer, what affirmative standard that reviewer
must apply, or whether legislative silence/absence of dissent is enough to
change the active path. An auditor's self-authored explanation plus a single
technical review can be mistaken for independent validation, despite the
draft's own same-substrate and scratch-evidence limitations.

**Falsifier:** recusal of any office that authored a competing stream from
recommending its own active designation; a reviewer appointed under a recorded
rule, independent of both source histories; a positive written standard of
review; and an explicit Parliament decision before a path change where verdict
semantics are affected. **Severity: MAJOR.**

## O6. The exception has no actual sunset despite §6's “Review and sunset” heading.

**Clause:** §6; assumptions schedule review date.

§6 sets a review on 2026-11-02 or after a qualifying reconciliation and a box
restart, whichever is later. If no qualifying event occurs by November 2, it
requires recording that the rule is untested and reviewing whether authority is
still needed. It does **not** say the Act or the §3.1 exception expires, sunsets,
or becomes inoperative if no renewal vote occurs. A one-off, event-triggered
exception to a records safety invariant can therefore remain on the books
indefinitely after a quiet window, notwithstanding the heading and the
assumptions schedule's own caution that zero incidents is not evidence of
benefit.

**Falsifier:** an automatic expiry date or maximum number of qualifying uses,
after which renewed legislative authorization is required; a quiet window must
not count as successful evidence. **Severity: MAJOR.**

## O7. The trigger covers any `records/` collision, while safeguards and claimed value were developed around two unusually sensitive correction logs and one suite-status file.

**Clause:** §3.1, §§3.2–3.5, §4.

The trigger applies to any canonical fast-forward/integration blocked by an
untracked durable record under `records/` that the target tracks, or a tracked
durable record with local changes that the target would overwrite. That is
broader than the correction-anchor collision described in §1 and the cited
examples. Act 12 §12.5 protects all records and durable Git records, potentially
including ballots, assumptions, incident evidence and other records with
different statutory integrity rules. The bill supplies one generic inventory,
archive, and active-source process, but only gives concrete collision semantics
for JSONL corrections and a generated suite-status file. An “exact source stream
selection” mechanism suitable to one format is not automatically safe for a
ballot, signed authorization, or other append-only record type.

The draft's narrow trigger is a strength, but it is path/type-agnostic and can
turn a targeted Act 12 amendment into a standing exception over protected
records. Event-triggering is not the same as a narrow eligible-record class.

**Falsifier:** enumerate the covered record classes and expressly exclude
ballots, laws, mandates, Founder communications/receipts, credentials, and
records with their own append-only or signature semantics unless separately
authorized. For the initial Act, limit use to the named correction-log and
generated-status collision classes. **Severity: MAJOR.**

## O8. The preservation manifest does not yet guarantee durable, collision-free custody across repeated attempts.

**Clauses:** §§3.2, 3.4–3.5; assumptions Claim 1 and Claim 2.

The report requires hashes, lengths, row counts, source refs “where known,”
independent reproduction, and an “unambiguous archival path.” It does not define
a collision-proof path scheme tying every archived variant to its source hash
and custody event, nor a no-overwrite rule if a later attempt finds another
variant at the same nominal source location. §3.5 checks that each source event
appears in at least one preserved source, but not that every prior archive and
manifest remains reachable and unchanged after a second reconciliation attempt.
The relevant source records include untracked canonical files, an Auditor branch
on a divergent base, and locally modified generated state; custody and provenance
are not equivalent for those categories.

This falls short of a durable append-only preservation guarantee. A manifest
that can be replaced, or an archive path that is reused, converts an apparently
source-preserving operation into an untraceable overwrite while still passing a
single-run hash check.

**Falsifier:** content-addressed or otherwise collision-resistant archive names
that include source hash and attempt identity; an append-only manifest anchored
in the integration history; explicit refusal to overwrite any existing archive;
and a repeat-use test proving old manifest and source objects remain reachable.
**Severity: MAJOR.**

## O9. The demonstrated benefit is a scratch Git result, not evidence the full legal procedure can lawfully or operationally complete.

**Clauses:** §§1, 3.5, 4, 6; assumptions Claims 1, 3 and 4.

The draft accurately says scratch work establishes technical feasibility only.
But its benefit claim rests on reducing repeated failed integration attempts,
while the scratch report says the source-preserving resolution is not shown to
be Act 17-compliant; the legal opinion concludes that canonical staging is
ambiguous; and the Act 21 status-file case introduces a further exact-tree
constraint. The draft's own process can halt when the active source cannot be
lawfully designated, when review dissents, or when exact Act 21 verification is
unavailable. A rule that authorizes a lengthy manifest/review procedure but
leaves the live collision blocked may add ceremony without its claimed benefit.

This is not an argument to treat scratch outputs as false. It is an argument
that the Act's central benefit is currently unproven and that the stop conditions
may dominate the success path. The assumptions schedule says no-incident is
“not exercised,” but does not provide a success metric distinguishing a lawful
resolution from an authorized stop after many cycles.

**Falsifier:** a bounded pilot in disposable clones using exact source objects
and a specifically defined conflict taxonomy, with separate outcomes for
lawful completion, justified stop, retry count, total review effort and source
integrity; keep the canonical checkout untouched. Define in advance what level
of successful lawful completion justifies retaining the rule. **Severity:
MAJOR.**

## Constructive alternatives

### A1. Separate preservation from active verdict/history selection (O1, O2).

Authorize only inert, hash-verified preservation first. Do not replace the
active correction path under this Act. If the variants encode different verdict
or confirmation semantics, leave the authoritative path blocked and return the
case to the Legislature under Act 17's stronger-evidence correction procedure;
any actual correction must meet Act 17 §1–§4 rather than rely on source-branch
selection.

### A2. Make the Act 12 legal change explicit and prospective (O4).

Replace “clarified” with a narrowly drafted amendment to Act 12 §12.5 that
names the permitted Git-index/tracking operation, the protected bytes that must
remain untouched, prohibited moves/deletes/rewrites, and the exact point at
which authority begins. State explicitly that scratch demonstrations and this
draft itself confer no permission.

### A3. Repair the Act 21 verification sequence before using suite-status as a completion gate (O3).

Require a deterministic, testable sequence that identifies which commit/tree is
verified, where the generated status record is committed, how that subsequent
records change is verified, and how the tree-hash rule applies without claiming
the status record verifies its own containing tree. If Act 21 needs amendment,
resolve it prospectively before relying on §3.4; otherwise stop honestly.

### A4. Add recusal, appointment, and decision standards (O5).

The Judiciary may report facts but should not recommend activation of its own
branch's source. Have Parliament appoint a non-source reviewer by recorded
decision, define a positive evidentiary standard, require a written finding,
and return any merits-affecting source choice to Parliament before integration.

### A5. Add a true sunset and limit record types (O6, O7).

Expire automatically on a fixed date or after a small, specified number of
qualifying uses unless Parliament renews it on evidence. Initially enumerate
only correction JSONL and suite-status conflicts; exclude ballots, laws and
other separately protected record classes.

### A6. Make archives collision-proof and repeatable (O8).

Use non-reusable archive paths keyed by source SHA-256 plus an attempt identifier;
append a hash-anchored manifest; refuse to overwrite any existing source copy or
manifest; test two successive attempts and prove all prior objects remain
reachable.

### A7. Measure a bounded technical pilot without touching canonical state (O9).

Use exact captured source objects in hermetic scratch clones only. Treat success
as Git-mechanics evidence, not merge authorization. Record completion, stop,
retry, reviewer effort and verification status separately, then let Parliament
decide from observed results whether the special authority has enough value to
continue.

---

## Recommendation

**Do not enact this draft as written.** The underlying collision is real, and
the proposal correctly prohibits blind deletion, overwrite and unreviewed
reconciliation. However, the central permission to designate one competing
correction stream as active can function as a verdict-history decision without
Act 17's case-specific stronger-evidence test (O1/O2); the suite-status gate has
no specified non-circular Act 21 sequence (O3); and the Act 12 exception is
broader and more durable than its “clarification” and “sunset” framing suggests
(O4/O6/O7). The evidence demonstrates scratch Git mechanics, not a lawful
canonical resolution or the claimed reduction in institutional delay (O9).

I would reconsider a narrowed bill that explicitly amends Act 12 prospectively,
separates byte preservation from active verdict selection, routes any
semantics-changing correction through Act 17, resolves the Act 21 status-record
sequence, defines recusal/review, limits eligible record classes, and truly
expires absent evidence-backed renewal. The immediate safe alternative remains
to preserve the source objects and report the integration blocker while the
Legislature resolves authority; an unresolved fast-forward is preferable to an
unreviewed change in the authoritative correction history.
