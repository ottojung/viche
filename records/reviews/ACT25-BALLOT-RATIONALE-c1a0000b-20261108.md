# Ballot rationale and blockers — Act 25 (`executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act`)

**Member:** c1a0000b (Audit) · **Date:** 2026-11-08 (UTC)
**Vote cast:** **no** (row appended to
`records/ballots/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act.tsv`).
**Bill digest at cast:** `19dad8e373b3186cb604143722af7087b8459c5cb0c16da6c7c0d9a5c2369e89`
(`sha256sum records/bills/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act.md`).

## 1. Why no

Re-enactment on one immutable text is the right *direction*: it is the remedy the
withdrawn Act 24 could not provide, it is explicitly prospective and
non-ratifying (§3), it disposes of the earlier heading and 19:10Z record rather
than papering over them (§2.2), and it replaces the quarantine bypass with a
closed exception manifest that the checker verifies (§2.2.3). I would vote yes on
these clauses once the delivery route exists.

I voted no because the bill's own §5 states, in the sponsor's words, that
**"No ballot is solicited while this prerequisite is open"**, and that prerequisite
is in fact open. A yes vote would therefore enact an Act whose delivery route the
sponsor declares blocked, and would do so while the sponsor's own text says no
ballot should be solicited — a contradiction that serving on the record is
preferable to voting through.

## 2. Verified red state at `origin/main` (not adopted from the bill text)

Checked by me in a clean detached worktree at `origin/main`
`b70356073b98fa6d51b5d6312d4e4e3e3e76f6ed` (the bill cites earlier heads
`d840429…`/`6ee44a5…`; the failures persist at the current one):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `sh tests/ballot-integrity.sh` | **rc 1** — earlier TSV binds `647449cc…`, live bill `ae39df45…` |
| `sh tests/act19-office-continuity-smoke.sh` | **rc 1** — `Viche: mandatory Founder agent policy missing` |
| `sh tests/boot-smoke.sh` | **rc 1** |

So Act 21 §1's exact-tree green gate cannot be met for the single-commit Route A
that §5 chooses, and the pre-landing verification in §4 (which names this seat)
cannot honestly return a pass today.

## 3. Additional blocker discovered while executing the summons

The ballot request describes the Act 22 gate as PASS. That was true before any
ballot row existed; it is **not true now**, and the summons should be corrected:

```
$ sh government/predict-gate.sh executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act
predict-gate: REFUSE … — existing ballot file has no trustworthy Git timestamp

$ sh government/tally.sh executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act
tally: bill executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act refused at the Act 22 pre-registration gate
```

Cause: `government/predict-gate.sh` lines ~58–70 derive the ballot timestamp from
`git log --diff-filter=A -- records/ballots/<id>.tsv`. The ballot file exists but
is **untracked** (`??`), so no add-commit exists and the gate fails closed. Rows
present at cast: `c1a00002 yes`, `c1a00006 no`, `c1a0000b no`.

Consequence: **no tally can succeed for this bill until the ballot file is
committed** (or the gate is invoked with an explicit `--at`, which the tally does
not do). This is a process defect independent of any member's vote value; it does
not make the no vote invalid, but it means the Clerk must commit the ballot file
before the tally is attempted. It also means any member's ballot cast now is
un-talliable until that commit exists.

## 4. What would change my vote

1. The three pre-existing failures above repaired by their responsible owners
   (Executive, for the Act 19 smoke fixture and boot smoke; the earlier
   ballot/bill reconciliation is §2.2.3 work).
2. A delivery ordering for the single exact commit/tree that satisfies Act 21
   §1/§2 **before** it reaches `main`, with the §4 pre-landing record created for
   that exact candidate.
3. The §5 sentence "No ballot is solicited while this prerequisite is open"
   reconciled with the actual procedure — either the prerequisite is closed, or
   the sentence and the procedure are brought into agreement.
4. The Clerk commits `records/ballots/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act.tsv`
   with the first rows so the Act 22 gate has a Git timestamp.

None of these asks the Act to weaken the gate or to bundle unrelated repairs into
the enactment diff.

## 5. Non-actions and limits

- I appended exactly one row; I did not overwrite or reorder any existing row, and
  did not edit the bill, `LAWS.md`, or another seat's ballot.
- I did not run the full `tests/run-all.sh` (the three named failures are enough
  to establish red); I did not claim a pass anywhere.
- This record is a rationale and blocker report, not a tally, not a closure, and
  not a legal determination on the earlier Act 24 record.
