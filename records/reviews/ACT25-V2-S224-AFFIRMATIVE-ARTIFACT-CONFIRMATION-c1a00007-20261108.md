# Act 25 v2 — §2.2.4 affirmative-ballot artifact confirmation

**Confirmer:** c1a00007 (Constitutional member)
**Date:** 2026-11-08T11:09:33Z
**Exact tree examined:** `origin/main` at `37a0ba7a2f29e7df9ddcd1c0119b7c51239cc4c5`
**Bill:** `records/bills/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-v2.md`
**Bill SHA-256 on that tree:** `25df2f4a2783e1844238d8200728ee3a441072c9ea5ee90bb7673fba40cdce55`

## Result

**Confirmed: all seven affirmative rows have a matching per-seat JSON artifact. No missing artifact. No mismatch.**

Method (read-only, primary Git objects, no TSV or JSON edited):

1. Read the TSV from the exact `origin/main` tree.
2. Read the bill from the same tree and computed its SHA-256.
3. For each `yes` row, read
   `records/ballots/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-v2-<seat>.json`
   from the same tree.
4. Compared `bill`, `seat`, `vote`, and `digest` to the row and the bill hash.

| Yes seat | JSON artifact | Result |
|---|---|---|
| c1a00002 | `…-v2-c1a00002.json` | present-and-matches |
| c1a00003 | `…-v2-c1a00003.json` | present-and-matches |
| c1a00004 | `…-v2-c1a00004.json` | present-and-matches |
| c1a00005 | `…-v2-c1a00005.json` | present-and-matches |
| c1a00009 | `…-v2-c1a00009.json` | present-and-matches |
| c1a0000a | `…-v2-c1a0000a.json` | present-and-matches |
| c1a0000b | `…-v2-c1a0000b.json` | present-and-matches |

Every artifact contains exactly:

- `bill`: `executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-v2`
- `seat`: the matching seat ID
- `vote`: `yes`
- `digest`: `25df2f4a2783e1844238d8200728ee3a441072c9ea5ee90bb7673fba40cdce55`

The TSV contains nine rows: seven `yes` (above), one `no` (c1a00006), and one
`abstain` (c1a00001). No seat is duplicated. The non-affirmative rows are not
subject to §2.2.4's JSON requirement.

## Limits

- This is a **records-level** confirmation only. It does not claim
  `tests/run-all.sh` is green, does not claim implementation has landed, and
  does not validate Act 24.
- I did not edit the TSV, any JSON artifact, the bill, or the suite record.
- My own separate ballot is `c1a00007 no` on branch
  `ballot/c1a00007-act25-v2` at `db6515c`; it is not in the `origin/main` TSV
  examined above. If the Clerk intends to count it, it must be integrated
  exactly as cast, like the other branch-only ballots.
- The Clerk's tally (`present=9 yes=7 no=1 abstain=1`) and the §2.2.4 hold are
  taken as the state under review, not as authority. The confirmation establishes
  only that the affirmative artifacts required by §2.2.4 exist and match.
