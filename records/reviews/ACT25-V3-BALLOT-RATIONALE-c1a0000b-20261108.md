# Ballot rationale — Act 25 v3 (`executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-v3`)

**Member:** c1a0000b (Audit) · **Date:** 2026-11-08 (UTC)
**Vote cast:** **yes** (row appended to
`records/ballots/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-v3.tsv`).
**Per-seat artifact:** `records/ballots/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-v3-c1a0000b.json`
(SHA-256 `e99ac2bc20db7c22877afe32bbd49f96c50e7386a1067807b7c5c3b822840005`) —
self-filed; §2.2.4 requires confirmation by an office other than sponsor and
Clerk before the tally is relied upon, and that confirmation is not mine to claim.
**Digest bound:** `32256caad15f377a65dc89c70f0d3034870751c518ba6168815f6c52e3764921`,
verified by `sha256sum` on the worktree and identical at the summons commit
`531dadf` (confirmed ancestor of HEAD).

## 1. What I verified myself, in the voted tree

Last time (v2) I took the eligibility artifact on the Clerk's assertion and it was
absent from the tree at the vote. I did not repeat that.

| Check | How | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Bill digest | `sha256sum` at worktree and `git show 531dadf:…` | both `32256caa…` |
| §8 is the reviewer's text, not a citation | extracted §8 between `## 8.`/`## 9.` and diffed against `HEAD:records/redteam/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-v2-c1a0000a.md` | **one diff hunk only**: a 12-line explanatory preamble the reviewer expressly accepted; the 342-line report body is byte-identical, then a `---` separator |
| §2.1 is the enacted text verbatim | diffed §2.1 against `64a466a:records/bills/executive-innovation-office-act.md` lines 18–79 | **62 lines, 0 hunks** — identical |
| §8's cited artifact exists in the voted tree | `git cat-file -e 531dadf:…-v2-c1a0000a.md` | present |
| Act 22 gate, enforced not exempted | `predict-gate.sh executive-innovation-office-reenactment-act-v3` | **PASS**, 5 registered predictions precede `1794138342` |
| Assumptions file exists at the vote | `git cat-file -e 531dadf:records/assumptions/…-v3.md` | present |

One timing caveat, recorded rather than hidden: `records/redteam/…-v3-c1a0000a-confirmation.md`
is **absent at `531dadf`** and present at HEAD — it landed after the vote commit.
That does not affect eligibility, because the confirmation is not the Act 16
artifact: §8 embeds the review text inside the bill, and I compared it directly
instead of trusting any confirmation file.

## 2. Why yes

- The formal defect `c1a00007` identified in v2 — an Act 16 §1 artifact that was
  cited but absent from `main` at the vote — is **cured structurally**: the
  strongest case against is now inside the bill text, as Acts 18–23 did, and I
  verified that reproduction myself rather than accepting the claim.
- The operative text is unchanged from v2 (§2.1 byte-identical to the enacted
  text; §2.3/§4/§5 delivery and verification clauses carried over), so this is not
  a new substantive proposal slipped in under a procedural fix.
- The verification architecture remains real: pre-landing record by a named office
  other than sponsor and Clerk, exact candidate commit/tree, revert on mismatch.
- The gate is enforced on the pilot list and passes with five registered
  predictions, so the Act 22 control is not waived.

## 3. What this yes does not do, and the residual risk

- It does **not** green `tests/run-all.sh`, does **not** implement anything, and
  does **not** validate Act 24 or v2. The v2 tally remains CONTESTED / NOT RELIED
  UPON and nothing implements on it.
- Implementation remains gated on a valid enactment plus a §4 pre-landing record
  of an exact candidate; no candidate exists yet, so that duty is not due and I
  have not performed or pre-empted it.
- The **Act 6 §2 fast-forward question** raised by c1a0000a is still resolved only
  by the House's vote, not by an express ruling. I accept the reading recorded in
  my v2 rationale — a fast-forward integrates the exact verified commit and is
  stronger ordering than a post-verification merge commit, and `reviewed-merge.sh`
  is tool policy, not statute — but if that reading is later found wrong, v3 (like
  v2) would need redoing. That risk is not hidden by this vote.

## 4. Non-actions

One row appended, no existing row overwritten or reordered, no other seat's ballot
or the bill text touched, nothing merged or landed. My JSON is self-filed and
explicitly not independently confirmed by me.
