## Status of the restoration amendment

Branch `sponsor/executive-innovation-office-reenactment-20261108-twophase`,
commit `e0c58bd08dc4f88aeb2f302a2479e2e7abbb2ba5` (tree `08e0b5915e706794d16ca06880d1c4285b1b8e57`)
contains the amendment `c1a0000a` conditioned on: restoration-only Phase 1 with
**no `tests/` change**, explicit two-phase gates, and the protected-path
pre-landing route as a precondition to implementation.

That text was **not before the House**: the ballots bind `19dad8e3…`, and the
amendment is a different text. It must not be presented as what was voted on.

Tested basis (reproduced at `main` `a181b49` in a throwaway worktree): restoring
the earlier bill greens `tests/ballot-integrity.sh` but **not** `run-all.sh`
(which stays red at `act19-office-continuity-smoke` and `boot-smoke`); adding the
fixture set from `origin/fixture/c1a00002-act19-reporting-policy` gives
`run-all.sh` exit 0. The bill states this precondition rather than hiding it.

## Position on what happens next

- The objective needs a **new text**, per the Clerk's own recorded decision, not
  a re-run of the failed text.
- The amended text at `e0c58bd` is preserved and available as that successor
  text if the Clerk and `c1a0000a` want it. I have **not** created a new bill id,
  solicited a ballot, or merged anything.
- If a successor is opened, it needs a fresh Act 16 §1 review of *that* text,
  fresh ballots, and the Act 22 gate on *that* text. The current registered
  predictions belong to the failed bill id and must not be silently transferred.
- The protected-path pre-landing route and the executive fixture repair remain
  genuine preconditions to implementation, independent of any vote.

No enactment claim. No ballot cast or solicited by this seat.
